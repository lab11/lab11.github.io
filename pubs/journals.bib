	abstract = {A 1.0~mm general-purpose sensor node platform with heterogeneous multi-layer structure is proposed.  The sensor platform benefits from modularity by allowing the addition/removal of IC layers. A new low power I$^2$C interface is introduced for energy efficient inter-layer communication with compatibility to commercial I$^2$C protocols. A self-adapting power management unit is proposed for efficient battery voltage down conversion for wide range of battery voltages and load current. The power management unit also adapts itself by monitoring energy harvesting conditions and harvesting sources and is capable of harvesting from solar, thermal and microbial fuel cells. An optical wakeup receiver is proposed for sensor node programming and synchronization with 228~pW standby power. The system also includes two processors, timer, temperature sensor, and low-power imager. Standby power of the system is 11~nW.},

	abstract = {{\bf Introduction:} Mobile phones hold considerable promise for delivering evidence-based smoking cessation interventions that require frequent and objective assessment of smoking status via breath carbon monoxide (Breath CO) measurement. However, there are currently no commercially available mobile-phone-based Breath CO meters. We developed a mobile-phone-based Breath CO meter prototype that attaches to and communicates with a smartphone through an audio port. The purpose of the current study was to evaluate the reliability and validity of Breath CO measures collected with the mobile meter prototype and assess the usability and acceptability of the meter.

		{\bf Methods:} Participants included 20 regular smokers (≥10 cigarettes/day), 20 light smokers (<10 cigarettes/day), and 20 nonsmokers. Expired air samples were collected 4 times from each participant: twice with the mobile meter and twice with a com- mercially available Breath CO meter.

		{\bf Results:} Measures calculated by the mobile meter correlated strongly with measures calculated by the commercial meter (r = .96, p < .001). In addition, the mobile meter accurately distinguished between smokers and nonsmokers. The area under the receiver-operating characteristic curve for the mobile meter was 94.7\%, and the meter had a combined sensitivity and specificity of 1.86 at an abstinence threshold of ≤6 ppm. Responses on an acceptability survey indicated that smokers liked the meter and would be interested in using it during a quit attempt.

		{\bf Conclusions:} The results of the current study suggest that a mobile-phone-based Breath CO meter is a reliable, valid, and acceptable device for distinguishing between smokers and nonsmokers.

	With the advent of DIY smart homes and the Internet of Things comes the

	the design trade-offs between the different representations of a smart home’s

	different smart home abstractions affect end users’ mental models of a
	hypothetical system. We develop four questionnaires, each of which describes
	the same hypothetical smart home using a different abstraction, and then we
	collect responses depicting desired smart home applications from over 1,500
	Mechanical Turk workers. We find that the choice of abstraction strongly primes
	end users’ responses. In particular, the purely device-oriented abstraction
	results in the most limited scenarios, suggesting that if we want users to
	associate smart home technologies with valuable high-level applications we
	should shift the UI paradigm for the Internet of Things from device-oriented
	control to other abstractions that inspire a greater diversity of interactions.

   We introduce \emph{Harmonium}, a novel ultra-wideband RF localization architecture
   that achieves decimeter-scale accuracy indoors.
   Harmonium strikes a balance between tag simplicity and processing complexity to
   provide fast and accurate indoor location estimates.
   Harmonium uses only commodity components and consists of a small, inexpensive,
   lightweight, and FCC-compliant ultra-wideband transmitter or \emph{tag}, fixed
   infrastructure \emph{anchors} with known locations, and centralized processing
   that calculates the tag's position.
   Anchors employ a new frequency-stepped narrowband receiver architecture that
   rejects narrowband interferers and
   extracts high-resolution timing information without the cost or complexity of
   traditional ultra-wideband approaches.
   In a complex indoor environment, 90\% of position estimates obtained with
   Harmonium exhibit less than 31\,cm of error with an average of 9\,cm of inter-sample
   noise.
   In non-line-of-sight conditions (i.e. through-wall), 90\% of position error is
   less than 42\,cm.
   The tag draws 75\,mW when actively transmitting, or 3.9\,mJ per location fix
   at the 19\,Hz update rate.  Tags weigh 3\,g and cost \$4.50\,USD at modest
   volumes.
   Furthermore, VLSI-based design concepts are identified for a simple, low-power
   realization of the Harmonium tag to offer a roadmap for the realization of Harmonium
   concepts in future integrated systems.
   Harmonium introduces a new design point for indoor localization
   and enables localization of small, fast objects such as micro quadrotors,
   devices previously restricted to expensive optical motion capture
   systems.

    The smartphone is an incredible computing platform. Loaded with powerful processing, vast data storage, near-global connectivity, built-in batteries, and a rich array of sensors, these devices reliably service the needs of billions of users every day. However, when tasked to run just a single application continuously without any human interaction, the smartphone platform becomes surprisingly unreliable. Over the course of a four-month deployment of Android-phone-based cellular gateways in Zanzibar, Tanzania, all 16 deployed phones failed despite significant engineering efforts, and six phones became physically damaged. This article examines what went wrong and how mobile computing platforms could adapt to support more traditional embedded computing roles and workloads.

    Governments around the world have become increasingly frustrated with tech giants dictating public
    health policy. The software created by Apple and Google enables individuals to track their own potential
    exposure through collated exposure notifications. However, the same software prohibits location tracking,
    denying key information needed by public health officials for robust contract tracing. This information
    is needed to treat and isolate COVID-19 positive people, identify transmission hotspots, and protect
    against continued spread of infection. In this article, we present two simple ideas: the lighthouse and the
    covid-commons that address the needs of public health authorities while preserving the privacy-sensitive

 abstract = {Office-based workplaces are an important but understudied context for infectious disease transmission. We examined the feasibility of two different sensors (Opos and Bluetooth beacons) for collecting person-to-person contacts and hand hygiene in office-based workplaces. Opo is an interaction sensor that captures sensor-to-sensor interactions through ultrasonic frequencies, which correspond to face-to-face contacts between study participants. Opos were additionally used to measure hand hygiene events by affixing sensors to soap and alcohol-based hand sanitizer dispensers. Bluetooth beacons were used in conjunction with a smartphone application and recorded proximity contacts between study participants. Participants in two office sites were followed for one-week in their workplace in March 2018. Contact patterns varied by time of day and day of the week. Face-to-face contacts were of shorter mean duration than proximity contacts. Supervisors had fewer proximity contacts but more face-to-face contacts than non-supervisors. Self-reported hand hygiene was substantively higher than sensor-collected hand hygiene events and duration of hand washing events was short (median: 9 seconds, range: 2.5–33 seconds). Given that office settings are key environments in which working age populations spend a large proportion of their time and interactions, a better characterization of empirical social networks and hand hygiene behaviors for workplace interactions are needed to mitigate outbreaks and prepare for pandemics. Our study demonstrates that implementing sensor technologies for tracking interactions and behaviors in offices is feasible and can provide new insights into real-world social networks and hygiene practices. We identified key social interactions, variability in hand hygiene, and differences in interactions by workplace roles. High-resolution network data will be essential for identifying the most effective ways to mitigate infectious disease transmission and develop pandemic preparedness plans for the workplace setting.},

 abstract = {Smart space technologies have entered the mainstream home market. Most users currently interact with smart homes that they (or an acquaintance) have set up and know well. However, as these technologies spread to commercial or public environments, users will need to frequently interact with unfamiliar smart spaces where they are unaware of the available capabilities and the system maintainer will not be present to help. Users will need to quickly and independently 1) discover what is and is not possible, and 2) make use of available functionality. Widespread adoption of smart space systems will not be possible until this discoverability issue is solved. We design and evaluate ARticulate, an interface that allows users to have successful smart space interactions with an intelligent assistant while learning transferable information about the overall set of devices in an unfamiliar space. Our method of using Snapchat-like contextual photo messages enhanced by two technologies---augmented reality and autocomplete---allows users to determine available functionality and achieve their goals in one attempt with a smart space they have never seen before, something no existing interface supports. The ability to easily operate unfamiliar smart spaces improves the usability of existing systems and removes a significant obstacle to the vision of ubiquitous computing.},
