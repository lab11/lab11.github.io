	abstract = {A 1.0~mm general-purpose sensor node platform with heterogeneous multi-layer structure is proposed.  The sensor platform benefits from modularity by allowing the addition/removal of IC layers. A new low power I$^2$C interface is introduced for energy efficient inter-layer communication with compatibility to commercial I$^2$C protocols. A self-adapting power management unit is proposed for efficient battery voltage down conversion for wide range of battery voltages and load current. The power management unit also adapts itself by monitoring energy harvesting conditions and harvesting sources and is capable of harvesting from solar, thermal and microbial fuel cells. An optical wakeup receiver is proposed for sensor node programming and synchronization with 228~pW standby power. The system also includes two processors, timer, temperature sensor, and low-power imager. Standby power of the system is 11~nW.},

	abstract = {{\bf Introduction:} Mobile phones hold considerable promise for delivering evidence-based smoking cessation interventions that require frequent and objective assessment of smoking status via breath carbon monoxide (Breath CO) measurement. However, there are currently no commercially available mobile-phone-based Breath CO meters. We developed a mobile-phone-based Breath CO meter prototype that attaches to and communicates with a smartphone through an audio port. The purpose of the current study was to evaluate the reliability and validity of Breath CO measures collected with the mobile meter prototype and assess the usability and acceptability of the meter.

		{\bf Methods:} Participants included 20 regular smokers (≥10 cigarettes/day), 20 light smokers (<10 cigarettes/day), and 20 nonsmokers. Expired air samples were collected 4 times from each participant: twice with the mobile meter and twice with a com- mercially available Breath CO meter.

		{\bf Results:} Measures calculated by the mobile meter correlated strongly with measures calculated by the commercial meter (r = .96, p < .001). In addition, the mobile meter accurately distinguished between smokers and nonsmokers. The area under the receiver-operating characteristic curve for the mobile meter was 94.7\%, and the meter had a combined sensitivity and specificity of 1.86 at an abstinence threshold of ≤6 ppm. Responses on an acceptability survey indicated that smokers liked the meter and would be interested in using it during a quit attempt.

		{\bf Conclusions:} The results of the current study suggest that a mobile-phone-based Breath CO meter is a reliable, valid, and acceptable device for distinguishing between smokers and nonsmokers.

	With the advent of DIY smart homes and the Internet of Things comes the
	emergence of user interfaces for domestic human-building interaction. However,
	the design trade-offs between the different representations of a smart home’s
	capabilities are still not well-understood. In this work, we examine how four
	different smart home abstractions affect end users’ mental models of a
	hypothetical system. We develop four questionnaires, each of which describes
	the same hypothetical smart home using a different abstraction, and then we
	collect responses depicting desired smart home applications from over 1,500
	Mechanical Turk workers. We find that the choice of abstraction strongly primes
	end users’ responses. In particular, the purely device-oriented abstraction
	results in the most limited scenarios, suggesting that if we want users to
	associate smart home technologies with valuable high-level applications we
	should shift the UI paradigm for the Internet of Things from device-oriented
	control to other abstractions that inspire a greater diversity of interactions.

   We introduce \emph{Harmonium}, a novel ultra-wideband RF localization architecture
   that achieves decimeter-scale accuracy indoors.
   Harmonium strikes a balance between tag simplicity and processing complexity to
   provide fast and accurate indoor location estimates.
   Harmonium uses only commodity components and consists of a small, inexpensive,
   lightweight, and FCC-compliant ultra-wideband transmitter or \emph{tag}, fixed
   infrastructure \emph{anchors} with known locations, and centralized processing
   that calculates the tag's position.
   Anchors employ a new frequency-stepped narrowband receiver architecture that
   rejects narrowband interferers and
   extracts high-resolution timing information without the cost or complexity of
   traditional ultra-wideband approaches.
   In a complex indoor environment, 90\% of position estimates obtained with
   Harmonium exhibit less than 31\,cm of error with an average of 9\,cm of inter-sample
   noise.
   In non-line-of-sight conditions (i.e. through-wall), 90\% of position error is
   less than 42\,cm.
   The tag draws 75\,mW when actively transmitting, or 3.9\,mJ per location fix
   at the 19\,Hz update rate.  Tags weigh 3\,g and cost \$4.50\,USD at modest
   volumes.
   Furthermore, VLSI-based design concepts are identified for a simple, low-power
   realization of the Harmonium tag to offer a roadmap for the realization of Harmonium
   concepts in future integrated systems.
   Harmonium introduces a new design point for indoor localization
   and enables localization of small, fast objects such as micro quadrotors,
   devices previously restricted to expensive optical motion capture
   systems.

    The smartphone is an incredible computing platform. Loaded with powerful processing, vast data storage, near-global connectivity, built-in batteries, and a rich array of sensors, these devices reliably service the needs of billions of users every day. However, when tasked to run just a single application continuously without any human interaction, the smartphone platform becomes surprisingly unreliable. Over the course of a four-month deployment of Android-phone-based cellular gateways in Zanzibar, Tanzania, all 16 deployed phones failed despite significant engineering efforts, and six phones became physically damaged. This article examines what went wrong and how mobile computing platforms could adapt to support more traditional embedded computing roles and workloads.

    Governments around the world have become increasingly frustrated with tech giants dictating public
    health policy. The software created by Apple and Google enables individuals to track their own potential
    exposure through collated exposure notifications. However, the same software prohibits location tracking,
    denying key information needed by public health officials for robust contract tracing. This information
    is needed to treat and isolate COVID-19 positive people, identify transmission hotspots, and protect
    against continued spread of infection. In this article, we present two simple ideas: the lighthouse and the
    covid-commons that address the needs of public health authorities while preserving the privacy-sensitive
    goals of the Apple and Google exposure notification protocols.
