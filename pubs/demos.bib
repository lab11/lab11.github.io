City-scale sensing holds the promise of enabling deeper insight into how our
urban environments function. Applications such as observing air quality and
measuring traffic flows can have powerful impacts, allowing city
planners and citizen scientists alike to understand and improve their world.
However, the path from conceiving applications to implementing them is fraught with difficulty.
A successful city-scale deployment requires physical installation, power
management, and communications---all challenging tasks standing between a good
idea and a realized one.

The Signpost platform, presented at IPSN 2018, has been created 
to address these challenges. Signpost
enables easy deployment by relying on harvested, solar energy and wireless
networking rather than their wired counterparts. To further lower the bar
to deploying applications, the platform provides the key resources necessary
to support its pluggable sensor modules in their distributed sensing tasks. 
In this demo, we present the Signpost hardware and
several applications running on a deployment of Signposts on UC Berkeley's campus,
including distributed, energy-adaptive traffic monitoring and 
fine grained weather reporting. Additionally we show the cloud infrastructure
supporting the Signpost deployment, specifically the ability to push new
applications and parameters down to existing sensors, with the goal of demonstrating that 
the existing deployment can serve as a future testbed.

The gateway is a key component for sensor network deployments and the Internet
of Things. Sensor deployments often tend towards low-power communication
protocols such as Bluetooth Low Energy or IEEE 802.15.4. Gateways are essential
to connect these devices to the Internet at large. Over time though, gateways
have gained additional responsibilities as well. Sensors expect gateways to
handle device-specific data translation and local processing while also
providing services, such as time synchronization, to the low-power device. As a
centralized computing resource, the gateway is also an obvious location for
running local applications which interact with sensor data and control nearby
actuators. Today, vendors and researchers often create their own
device-specific gateways to handle these responsibilities.

We propose a generic gateway platform capable of supporting the needs of many
devices. In our architecture, devices provide a pointer, such as a URL, to
descriptions of their interfaces. The gateway can download the interface
descriptions and use them to determine how to interact with the device,
translating its data to a usable format and enabling local services to
communicate with it. The translated data is provided to services including user
applications, local logging, device status monitoring, and cloud applications.
By simultaneously supporting communication with many sensors, our gateway
architecture can simplify future sensor network deployments and enable
intelligent building applications.

The era of city-scale sensing is dawning. Supported by new sensing
capabilities, the capability to detect and measure phenomena throughout a
large area will allow deeper insight and understanding into how cities work.
The challenge of city-scale sensing is not limited to developing new sensing
applications, however. A sensor must be installed in a location. It must be
provided power, storage, and communications. All these tasks stand aside from
the desired sensing effort, but are necessary nevertheless.

In this demo, we introduce an initial prototype for a modular, city-scale
sensing platform---the signpost network. The platform, designed to be physically
attached to sign posts throughout a city, reduces the burden for sensor and
application developers by providing the necessary resources to modules attached
to it. Power is provided by harvesting from solar panels with battery storage,
with each module allocated a certain subset of the system energy. The signpost
platform also provides data storage, long-range communication, data
processing, module isolation, and an installation point for connected
modules. The signpost acts as a modular base station for researchers, citizen
scientists, and other interested parties to deploy custom sensors for
applications such as pedestrian counting, air quality monitoring, and RF
spectrum sensing at a city-wide scale.

We present SurePoint, a system for drop-in, high-fidelity indoor localization.
SurePoint builds on recently available commercial ultra-wideband radio hardware.
While ultra-wideband radios provide a pairwise range estimate natively, we
show that with the addition of frequency and spatial diversity, we can achieve
a 53\% decrease in median range error.
Because this extra diversity requires many additional packets for each range
estimate, we leverage an efficient broadcast ranging protocol for
localization that ameliorates this overhead.
In stationary and fast-moving environments SurePoint achieves up to
0.08\,m median error and 0.53\,m 99th percentile error.
As ranging requires the tag to have exclusive access to the channel, we
employ a protocol to coordinate the localization of multiple tags in space.
This protocol builds on recent work exploiting the constructive interference
phenomenon, however SurePoint is the first to demonstrate constructive interface
using the 802.15.4a ultra-wideband PHY.
Finally, as the ranging protocol requires careful management of the
ultra-wideband radio and tight timing, we utilize TriPoint, a dedicated
``drop-in'' ranging module that provides a simple \iic interface. We show that
this additional microcontroller demands only marginal energy overhead while
facilitating interoperability by freeing the primary microcontroller to
handle other tasks.

This demo complements the paper ``SurePoint: Exploiting Ultra Wideband Flooding
and Diversity to Provide Robust, Scalable, High-Fidelity Indoor Localization''
to be presented at SenSys'16.

nearby sensors are used to provide a constant lighting service which attempts
to maintain a user-set brightness under variable external lighting conditions.

    Luxapose addresses the indoor localization problem
with unmodified smartphones and software controlled LED luminaires.
Each luminaire, while providing normal lighting for a space,
transmits an identifier by switching the luminaire on-and-off at a particular
frequency. The pulses are imperceptible to humans, but smartphone
cameras can detect the switching by exploiting the rolling shutter effect
of CMOS cameras. Once the camera captures an image, the image
is processed to find the luminaires, determine their identifiers,
construct a sufficiently constrained angle-of-arrival localization
problem, and ultimately calculate the smartphone's position and
orientation in space.

Luxapose requires LED lighting infrastructure for localization, however,
the LED lights can replace the current lighting in a building. Luxapose
has virtually no cost to the end-users, requiring just an app on the
smartphone they already carry. The system has demonstrated ninetieth percentile
position error of 10~cm and orientation error of 10~degrees when the
smartphone is held under the LED luminaires.

    abstract = { We are becoming increasingly surrounded by smart and connected devices,
        popularly known as the Internet of Things. The emerging user interface
        paradigm for many such things eschews physical buttons, knobs, and displays in
        favor of virtual interfaces that are downloaded from the web and rendered on
        remote platforms---like smartphones. However, such smartphone app-based
        interfaces often require tedious discovery and installation, as well as device
        discovery, pairing, and configuration before a user can interact with a nearby
        device. Requiring an explicit app install for each new device type scales
        poorly with device growth, and particularly hinders casual interactions with
        ambient devices. Instead of the high-friction, walled-garden approach now
        taking root, we propose name, a physical web browser that provides a seamless,
        scalable approach to browsing and interacting with nearby things. name
        leverages multiple network patterns and modern web technologies to provide
        users with rich device interfaces, even for devices under network or power
        constraints. We argue that this approach scales better and that it provides
        more intuitive and natural functionality for both users and developers. This
        demo presents the basic concept, allows others to experience our preliminary
        implementation, and raises several open research questions.
