The worldâ€™s population is flocking to city centers at an increasing rate,
testing the ability of urban planners and local governments to address new
problems in transportation, waste disposal, urban health, and public
safety. While one could imagine solutions enabled by an emerging class of
smart sensors, current attempts at such systems are difficult to deploy and
single purpose in their design. If we expect researchers and
citizen-scientists to participate in the data-driven rejuvenation of our
urban spaces (and we should, since they are the ones experiencing the
day-to-day problems), we must lower the bar to deploying sensors
and accessing smart-city data. Towards this goal, we present Signpost, an
infrastructure-free sensing platform that aims to enable easy, multi-use
sensor deployments for citizens, and researchers who have little expertise
in building smart and connected sensors.
