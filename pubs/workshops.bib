		 devices and this, we argue, hampers their more widespread

		 size-constrained application settings like mobile phones and sensor
		 networks. To rectify this problem, we propose to put the
		 software-defined radio on a diet by redesigning it around just
		 two core chips -- an integrated RF transceiver and a
		 Flash-based, mixed-signal FPGA. Modern transceivers integrate
		 almost all RF front-end functions while emerging FPGAs
		 integrate nearly all of required signal conditioning and
		 processing functions. And, unlike conventional FPGAs,
		 Flash-based FPGAs offer sleep mode power draws measured in the
		 microamps and startup times measured in the microseconds,
		 both of which are critical for low-power operation. If our platform

		 a software-defined radio in the palm of one’s hand, build it
		 for \$100, and power it for days using the energy in a

		The SmartGrid is ushering in an era of new IP endpoints that already
		reside on the power grid today, but lack network connectivity.  Many
		of these endpoints -- refrigerators, air conditioners, and power
		strips -- will be networked wirelessly.  However, since they already
		exist on the power grid, a natural question is whether they might be
		networked over the same wires that supply their power.  Such an
		approach would allow SmartGrid sensors to vacate increasingly
		congested spectrum and allow information to flow along the same path
		as power, perhaps simplifying deployment in the short term and deep
		demand response in the long term.
		In this paper we explore the current state of Powerline Communications
		(PLC) and explore the efficacy of PLC as a sensor network backbone in
		a modern building.  We evaluate several different PLC modems in both
		end-to-end and multi-hop configurations.  We further analyze building
		blueprints to identify and correlate several PLC ``disruptors'' --
		building facets that inhibit PLC.  Our preliminary results show that
		PLC is a promising technology for networking sensors in the Smart
		Building.  However, a number of anomalies suggest a more in-depth

  Using our prototyped applications, we next take a primitive stab at

   operating system kernels, but this effort has failed in most practical
     systems. In particular, solutions that sacrifice performance have been
     generally avoided. However, isolation techniques in modern languages can
     provide safety while avoiding performance issues. Moreover, utilizing a
     type-safe language with no garbage collector or other runtime services
     avoids what would otherwise be some of the largest sections of trusted
     code base. We report on our experiences in writing a resource efficient
     embedded kernel in Rust, finding that only a small set of unsafe
     abstractions are necessary in order to form common kernel building blocks.
     Further, we argue that Rust's choice to avoid runtime memory management by
     using a linear type system will enable the next generation of safe

     We believe that the future of human-building interaction lies
     in the mediation of human-human interactions. In this work
     we introduce a smart home application called Ghosting,
     which is a two-way telepresence system that synchronizes
     the audio and lighting state of two homes at a room level.
     This allows users to converse as they normally would while
     sharing a home, such as by talking while in the same room
     or by shouting across the house. Users can additionally experience
     in real time the casual yet intimate interactions of
     daily shared living, like hearing the remote occupant walking
     from room to room, coughing and shuffling papers just
     around the corner, and seeing the lights turn on and off.
     Due to its broad appeal, shared virtual living could lead to
     the widespread deployment of space synchronization infrastructure,
     forming a global home-to-home network. We
     explore the new applications and economies that could
     emerge from such a network, given the capabilities of the

   Embedded systems have long been synonymous with special purpose, single
   stakeholder computing. However, as these systems have become more capable and
   the demands placed on them have become more varied and variable, embedded
   software is beginning to embrace multi-tenancy.
   While the general problem of supporting multiple users and processes on a
   computing platform has been well explored in computer science, the
   challenges of supporting multiple users with competing desires on a highly
   energy-variable system remain unexplored.
   On an energy-harvesting platform, incoming energy needs to be distributed
   between stakeholders, and users accessing shared platform resources should
   be charged for the energy use of those resources.
   Furthermore, with system designers and application creators being
   increasingly removed from each other, the software environments of
   energy-harvesting platforms must provide primitives that enable applications
   to adapt to system variability.
   We explore several initial techniques for solving these problems and
   demonstrate them using Signpost---a modular, energy-harvesting platform for
   city-scale sensing.

When performing RF ranging in a complex indoor environment, the error of a
single channel estimate can vary widely. A key insight of the PolyPoint and
SurePoint ranging protocols is that individual nodes can efficiently capture
multiple independent samples of the RF channel. For each point in space, nodes
capture twenty seven independent samples by varying the spectrum sampled and
the polarization of antennas. This dataset includes all of the measurements
reported in the PolyPoint and SurePoint papers, which comprises several
thousand points in a complex indoor environment. Precise 3D coordinates of
nodes were captured using an optical motion capture system calibrated to

One of the largest impediments to pervasive sensing is ensuring equally
pervasive network access. While we can create wireless sensors that last for
years without human intervention, the network infrastructure to support their
deployment requires planning, power, and maintenance. The potential for a
crowd-based solution to this problem is ripe—ever pervasive smart phones have
the hardware and connectivity to serve as ubiquitous mobile gateways—however
the fragmentation of low power wireless protocols combined with the lack of
incentive for users to sacrifice their own resources transporting others’
data has made this approach untenable.

Through an “off label” use of Google’s Physical Web and Nearby Notifications,
it was possible to ignore these problems and exploit nearly the entire global
population of Android phones to slowly transport sensor data to an arbitrary
web server. This mechanism was enabled by default and transparent to the
phone’s user. On one hand, it served as an exciting opportunity to explore
infrastructure-free wireless networking. In a one week deployment of five
devices transmitting at 1 Hz, we were able to successfully transport 326 kB
of data with an average data rate of 0.1–2.6 bps. This is slow, but
sufficient for many applications such as environmental monitoring and sensor
status reporting. On the other hand, a mobile operating system probably
should not have enabled exfiltration of arbitrary data without a user’s
knowledge or consent. While Nearby Notifications has now been decommissioned,
we examine security policy requirements for future systems that interact with
nearby devices, and we envision a similar, intentional mechanism to allow
data hitchhiking for the Internet of Things.

  For the past decade, the status-quo for energy harvesting sensors has been to
  buffer small amounts of energy in capacitors to in- termittently work through
  a sensing task. While using capacitors for storage offers these systems
  indefinite lifetime, it comes at a cost – they must tolerate the decreased
  availability, lower en- ergy utilization, and more complex programming models
  inherent to a volatile, intermittent design. We argue that many of these
  problems stem from insufficient energy storage and could be elimi- nated with
  the use of batteries. Recent advances in rechargeable battery technology
  weaken the historical arguments against their use. We believe that using
  batteries in energy harvesting sensors will push us closer to a class of
  reliable, general purpose devices that can better serve human-centric sensing

    Long the case in automotive, aeronautics, and industrial settings, embedded
    systems in myriad other areas are becoming distributed systems in all but
    name. Driven by increasingly complex applications with wide-ranging
    hardware requirements, developers are turning to modular designs that
    integrate multiple processors onto a single board. Unfortunately,
    problems already familiar to distributed systems—coordinated execution,
    portable applications, and unified system-wide administration—have no
    corresponding embedded support and must be re-implemented in an ad hoc
    fashion for each application. We argue that future embedded operating
    system development should explicitly support these multi-microcontroller
    systems, and can leverage distributed techniques to do so. We also
    believe that the low-level nature of embedded sensing indicates that OSes
    should not attempt to completely abstract the presence of separate
    hardware components and capabilities. Instead, they should provide useful
    interfaces that support resource-constrained execution and modular
    application interactions. To that end, we identify existing embedded OS
    efforts and distributed systems concepts that can inform next-generation
    OS development.

  abstract = {As the Internet of Things (IoT) has grown more prevalent, the gateway has become a critical linchpin of IoT network architectures. To bring constrained embedded devices online, Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE) has proven to be particularly popular for the low power sensors and actuators pervasive in the consumer IoT market. And yet, the gateways that facilitate cloud connectivity for such devices incur burdensome time, cost, and unreliability. This problem persists because current gateways conflate many application-specific functions, which continues to fuel the trend of requiring separate expensive, custom, and over-provisioned solutions for each brand or class of device to establish reliable network connectivity. One route to address the problem is the over-provisioned gateways at the heart of Apple and Google's smart home offerings. Another approach involves adding ephemeral gateway functions on pervasive connected devices like smartphones. In this paper, we explore a third approach that strips the gateway down to its bare essentials and eliminates the rest. We test the approach on the Espressif ESP32, a \$3 microcontroller that contains built-in Wi-Fi and BLE radios, with a deployment of low-power IoT devices, evaluating the performance, drawbacks, and tradeoffs. Our results suggest that this is a promising technique for cost-sensitive applications with low deployment densities and aggregate data rates, but more capable design points may be preferred as these assumptions are relaxed.},

  abstract = {Traditional embedded systems rely on custom C code deployed in a monolithic firmware image. In these systems, all code must be trusted completely, as any code can directly modify memory or hardware registers. More recently, some embedded OSes have improved security by separating userspace applications from the kernel, using strong hardware isolation in the form of a memory protection unit (MPU). Unfortunately, this design requires either a large trusted computing base (TCB) containing all OS services, or moving many OS services into userspace. The large TCB approach offers no protection against seemingly-correct backdoored code, discouraging the use of kernel code produced by others and complicating security audits. OS services in userspace come at a cost to usability and efficiency. We posit that a model enabling two tiers of trust for kernel code is better suited to modern embedded software practices. In this paper, we present the threat model of the Tock Operating System, which is based on this idea. We compare this threat model to existing security approaches, and show how it provides useful guarantees to different stakeholders.},

Opportunistic networks require no fixed infrastructure and allow edge devices to piggy-back messages through stationary or mobile gateways. Research interest in such networks has waxed and waned over the years, but commercial deployments have not taken off until recently. Over the past year, we have witnessed a resurgence of interest fueled by wide-scale commercial deployments, most notably Amazon's Sidewalk network, but also Apple's Find My and the Tile network. As these networks become more prevalent, maintaining the privacy of the individuals who participate in them will become increasingly important. In this paper, we demonstrate that current opportunistic networks leak access patterns to the network operator itself through communication metadata, which can be used to reconstruct location traces. We argue that opportunistic networks and privacy are not mutually exclusive, and suggest some potential research directions to strengthen the privacy properties of these networks. Since opportunistic networks are now being deployed at massive scale, we argue that the time is ripe to make them privacy-preserving before it is too late.},
