Publications
============

To add your paper (yay!) to the website:

1. Put a copy of your paper in this folder
 - Please follow the naming convention: lastnameYEARname.pdf
2. Add a bibtex entry to the appropriate `.bib` file
 - In addition to the standard fields, be sure to include
   - `conference-url`: Link to the conference website
   - `abstract`: Abstract as copied from abstract.tex (e.g. leave in Latex form)
   - `acceptance-accepted`, `acceptance-total`: Conference statistics (usually
      are sent with your acceptance notification e-mail, don't lose them!)
 - If in doubt, look at the existing examples
