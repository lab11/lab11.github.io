  abstract = {In many engineering disciplines such as circuit board, chip, and mechanical design, a hardware description language (HDL) approach provides important benefits over direct manipulation interfaces by supporting concepts like abstraction and generator meta-programming. While several such HDLs have emerged recently and promised power and flexibility, they also present challenges – especially to designers familiar with current graphical workflows. In this work, we investigate an IDE approach to provide a graphical editor for a board-level circuit design HDL. Unlike GUI builders which convert an entire diagram to code, we instead propose generating equivalent HDL from individual graphical edit actions. By keeping code as the primary design input, we preserve the full power of the underlying HDL, while remaining useful even to advanced users. We discuss our concept, design considerations such as performance, system implementation, and report on the results of an exploratory remote user study with four experienced hardware designers. },

  abstract = {In much of the world, electricity grids are not instrumented at the customer level, limiting insights into the power quality experienced by utility customers. Moreover, to understand grid performance, regulators and investors must depend on utilities to self-report reliability data. To address these challenges, we introduce PowerWatch, an agile methodology to directly measure customer experience and aggregated grid performance without relying on the utility for deployment or management. PowerWatch employs a system of distributed sensors coupled with cloud-based analytics. We evaluate the PowerWatch methodology by deploying 462 sensors in homes and businesses in Accra, Ghana for over a year, yielding the largest open-source data set on electricity reliability at the customer-level in the region. We describe the architecture, design, and performance of PowerWatch, as well as the data that are collected, explaining how we determine the accuracy and coverage of our methodology without ground truth. Finally, we report on grid performance issues, finding nearly twice as many outages as the utility observed, suggesting a need for better grid performance monitoring.},

While novel tools experiment with higher levels of design, abstraction often comes at the expense of the fine-grained control afforded by low-level tools. In this work, we propose a hardware description language (HDL) approach that supports users at multiple levels of abstraction from broad system architecture to subcircuits and component selection. We extend the familiar hierarchical block diagram with polymorphism to include abstract-typed blocks (e.g., generic resistor supertype) and electronics modeling (i.e., currents and voltages). Such an approach brings the advantages of reusability and encapsulation from object-oriented programming, while addressing the unique needs of electronics designers such as physical correctness verification. We discuss the system design, including fundamental abstractions, the block diagram construction HDL, and user interfaces to inspect and fine-tune the design; demonstrate example designs built with our system; and present feedback from intermediate-level engineers who have worked with our system.},

Historically, systems measuring interactions have been forced to choose between deployability and measurement fidelity---they operate only in instrumented spaces, under line-of-sight conditions, or provide coarse-grained proximity data. We introduce SociTrack, a platform for autonomous social interaction tracking via wireless distance measurements. Deployments require no supporting infrastructure and provide sub-second, decimeter-accurate ranging information over multiple days. The key insight that enables both deployability and fidelity in one system is to decouple node mobility and network management from range measurement, which results in a novel dual-radio architecture. SociTrack leverages an energy-efficient and scalable ranging protocol that is accurate to 14.8 cm (99th percentile) in complex indoor environments and allows our prototype to operate for 12 days on a 2000 mAh battery. Finally, to validate its deployability and efficacy, SociTrack is used by early childhood development researchers to capture caregiver-infant interactions.},

We believe that a usable and functional system for circuit design needs to be able to interleave both levels of abstraction seamlessly and allow designers to transition between them freely. Existing work has experimented with approaches like circuit synthesis, functional characterization, or fine grained physical modeling. Each of these approaches augment the design process as it exists today, with its fundamental split between various levels of abstraction. We notice that hierarchical block diagrams can capture both high-level system structure as well as fine grained physical connectivity, and use that symmetry to construct a model for electronic circuits that can span the entire design process. Additionally, we construct user interfaces for our model that can support users of different skill levels throughout a design task. We discuss the design of our system, detailing both fundamental abstractions and usability trade-offs, and demonstrate its current capabilities through the design of example electronics projects.},

    As the number of Internet of Things devices continue to
    grow, a pattern of off-loading user control and interaction to
    individuals’ mobile devices has emerged. The user experience,
    however, is burdened by high-friction tasks, including device
    discovery, app installation, scanning, pairing, and configuration. 
    Additionally, the tools and systems currently employed
    to facilitate interaction vary in degree of usefulness, provide
    inconsistent support, and fail to mesh together in a meaningful way. 
    This user experience model scales poorly with the
    increasing population of “things”, and significantly hinders
    casual interactions with ambient devices, as well as regular
    interactions with persistent devices. To break away from this
    restrictive paradigm, we propose an architecture that provides
    a seamless, scalable approach to discovering and interacting
    with nearby “things” in both short- and long-term contexts.
    The system takes advantage of multiple network patterns and
    modern web technologies to supply users with rich device
    interfaces that can interact directly over local networking protocols. 
    A mobile app-based implementation of this system is
    tested with several embedded wireless devices. In our analysis, 
    we find that our method scales better than current popular
    models and that it enables powerful and complex functionality
    while remaining natural, intuitive, and secure for users.

    Low-power wide-area networks (LPWANs) are a compelling answer to the
    networking challenges faced by many Internet of Things devices. Their
    combination of low power, long range, and deployment ease has motivated a
    flurry of research, including exciting results on backscatter and
    interference cancellation that further lower power budgets and increase
    capacity. But despite the interest, we argue that unlicensed LPWAN
    technologies can only serve a narrow class of Internet of Things
    applications due to two principal challenges: capacity and coexistence.

    We propose a metric, bit flux, to describe networks and applications in
    terms of throughput over a coverage area. Using bit flux, we find that the
    combination of low bit rate and long range restricts the use case of LPWANs
    to sparse sensing applications. Furthermore, this lack of capacity leads
    networks to use as much available bandwidth as possible, and a lack of
    coexistence mechanisms causes poor performance in the presence of multiple,
    independently-administered networks. We discuss a variety of techniques and
    approaches that could be used to address these two challenges and enable
    LPWANs to achieve the promise of ubiquitous connectivity.

    The vision of sensor systems that collect critical and previously ungathered
      information about the world is often only realized when sensors, students,
    and subjects move outside the academic laboratory. However, deployments at
      even the smallest scales introduce complexities and risks that can be
      difficult for a research team to anticipate. Over the past year, our
      interdisciplinary team of engineers and economists has been designing,
    deploying, and operating a large sensor network in Accra, Ghana that
      measures power outages and quality at households and firms. This network
      consists of 457 custom sensors, over 3,000 mobile app instances,
    thousands of participant surveys, and custom user incentive and
      deployment management systems. In part, this deployment supports an
      evaluation of the impacts of investments in the grid on reliability and
      the subsequent effects of improvements in reliability on
      socioeconomic well-being. We report our experiences as we move from
      performing small pilot deployments to our current scale, attempting to
      identify the pain points at each stage of the deployment. Finally, we
      extract high-level observations and lessons learned from our
      deployment activities, which we wish we had originally known when
      forecasting budgets, human resources, and project timelines. These
      insights will be critical as we look toward scaling our deployment to the
      en-tire city of Accra and beyond, and we hope that they will encourage and

generation of complex, auditable, reliable, and reproducible incentive systems.
We call this infrastructure the Open INcentive Kit (OINK).
A review of recent literature from several communities finds that of the one hundred and twenty-one publications that incorporate
incentives, only thirty-one describe their incentive system in detail, and all of these could be implemented using OINK. We evaluate OINK in practice by using it for an active energy monitoring deployment in Ghana and find that OINK successfully facilitates thousands of individual incentive payments. Finally, we describe our efforts to generalize OINK for different research communities, specifically focusing on architectural decisions around extensibility to support unanticipated use cases. OINK is free and open-source software.

Today, most sensors that harvest energy from indoor solar, ambient RF, or
  thermal gradients buffer small amounts of energy in capacitors as they
  intermittently work through a sensing task. While the utilization of
  capacitors for energy storage affords these systems indefinite lifetimes,
their low energy capacity necessitates complex intermittent programming models
  for state retention and energy management. However, recent advances in
    battery technology lead us to reevaluate the impact that increased energy
      storage capacity may have on the necessity of these programming models
      and the reliability of energy harvesting sensors. In this paper, we
      propose a capacity-based framework to help structure energy harvesting
      sensor design, analyze the impact of capacity on key reliability metrics
      using a data-driven simulation, and consider how backup energy storage
      alters the design space. We find that for many designs that utilize solar
      energy harvesting, increasing energy storage capacity to 1-10 mWh can
      obviate the need for intermittent programming techniques, augment the
      total harvested energy by 1.4-2.3x, and improve the availability of a
      sensor by 1.3-2.6x. We also show that a hybrid design using energy
      harvesting with a secondary-cell battery and a backup primary-cell
      battery can achieve 2-4x the lifetime of primary-cell only designs while
      eliminating the failure modes present in energy harvesting systems.
      Finally, we implement an indoor, solar energy harvesting sensor based on
      our analysis and find that its behavior aligns with our simulation’s
      predictions.

Smart and connected devices offer enormous potential to enable
context-aware, localized, and multi-device orchestrations that could
substantially increase the reach and utility of computing.  The growth
of these applications has been hampered, however, as devices, their
data, and their control have been largely sequestered to their own
vendor-specific APIs, clouds, and applications---a largely stove-piped
state of affairs.  In instances where barriers between devices have
been pierced, the connections often occur between vendor clouds,
affecting the latency, privacy, and reliability of the original
application, while simultaneously making them more complex.  Locally
executing applications have not materialized as devices with
incompatible communication protocols, inconsistent APIs, and
incongruent data models rarely communicate. We claim that what is
needed to unlock the application potential is an architecture tailored
to facilitating applications composed of networked devices.

Our proposed architecture addresses this by providing a port-based abstraction
for devices using a small wrapper layer. This device abstraction
provides a consistent view of devices, and embeddable runtimes provide existing
applications straightforward access to devices. The architecture also supports
device discovery, shared interfaces between devices, and an application
specification interface that promotes creating device-agnostic applications
capable of operating even when devices change.  We demonstrate the efficacy of
our architecture with two application case studies that highlight the
abstraction layers between applications and devices and employ the
embeddability of our system to add new functionality to existing systems.

    Network connectivity is often one of the most challenging aspects of deploying
    sensors. In many countries, cellular networks provide the most reliable,
    highest bandwidth, and greatest coverage option for internet access. While this makes smartphones a seemingly ideal platform to serve as a gateway between sensors and the cloud,
    we find that a device designed for
    multi-tenant operation and frequent human interaction becomes unreliable
    when tasked to continuously run a single application with no human
    interaction, a seemingly counter-intuitive result. Further, we find that economy phones cannot physically
    withstand continuous operation, resulting in a surprisingly high rate of
    permanent device failures in the field. If these observations hold more broadly, they would make mobile phones
    poorly suited to a range of sensing applications for which they have been

    The U.S. Federal Government and commercial partners have identified a critical gap in today's measurement technology---the ability to accurately, inexpensively, and wirelessly submeter building electricity usage at the circuit-level. Such metering technology would enable building owners, operators, and occupants to characterize and curtail electricity use in buildings---a major cost and source of carbon emissions today. Existing circuit-level metering systems are too costly to deploy, due to difficult installation or cumbersome calibration processes, too inaccurate, due to an inability to faithfully calculate power from synchronized current and voltage channels, or too unreliable, due to a strong dependence on a frequently lossy wireless channel. We propose Triumvi, a standalone, self-powered, non-contact, true-power metering system to help make circuit-level metering affordable, accurate, and reliable---in short, usable. In a splitcore current transformer form factor, Triumvi harvests energy to power itself, monitors current and voltage, calculates power, encrypts data, and wirelessly transmits the results. Our prototype can sustain a sample rate of nearly 0.5\,Hz when the load draws at least 360\,W and exhibits an average error of 4.3\% over a load power draw range of 150--600\,W. Triumvi also supports rapid installation, incremental upgrades, metering three phase and high current loads, charge sharing between between meters, and current waveform analysis, creating a highly flexible metering system capable of energy audits, industrial equipment monitoring, and many applications in-between.

environments, but existing ultra wideband systems require tens to hundreds of
milliwatts during operation.
%
Backscatter communication has demonstrated the viability of astonishingly
low-power tags, but has thus far been restricted to
narrowband systems with low localization resolution.
%
The challenge to combining these complimentary technologies is that they
share a compounding limitation, constrained transmit power. Regulations limit
ultra wideband transmissions to just -41.3\,dBm/MHz, and a backscatter device
can only reflect the power it receives.
%
The solution is long-term integration of this limited power, lifting the
initially imperceptible signal out of the noise.
%
This integration only works while the target is stationary. However, stationary
describes the vast majority of objects, especially lost ones.
% especially things you are trying to find.
%
With this insight, we design Slocalization, a sub-microwatt,
decimeter-accurate localization system that opens a new tradeoff space in
localization systems and realizes an energy, size, and cost point that invites
the localization of every thing.
%
To evaluate this concept,
we implement an energy-harvesting Slocalization tag and find that
Slocalization can recover ultra wideband backscatter
in under fifteen minutes across thirty meters of space
and localize tags with a mean 3D Euclidean error of only 30\,cm.

City-scale sensing holds the promise of enabling a deeper understanding of our
urban environments.
However, a city-scale deployment requires physical installation,
power management, and communications---all challenging tasks standing between a
good idea and a realized one.
This indicates the need for a platform that enables easy deployment and
experimentation for applications operating at city scale.
To address these challenges, we present Signpost, a modular, energy-harvesting platform for city-scale sensing.
Signpost simplifies deployment by eliminating the need
for connection to wired infrastructure and instead harvesting energy from an
integrated solar panel. The platform furnishes the key resources necessary to
support multiple, pluggable sensor modules while providing
fair, safe, and reliable sharing in the face of dynamic energy constraints.
We deploy Signpost with several sensor modules, showing the viability
of an energy-harvesting, multi-tenant, sensing system, and evaluate its
ability to support sensing applications.
We believe Signpost reduces the difficulty inherent in city-scale deployments,
enables new experimentation, and provides improved insights into urban health.

     We present a method for calibration-free, infrastructure-free localization
	 in sensor networks. Our strategy is to estimate node positions and
	 noise distributions of all links in the network \emph{simultaneously}
	 -- a strategy that has not been attempted thus far. In particular, we
	 account for biased, non-line-of-sight (NLOS) range measurements from
	 ultra-wideband (UWB) devices that lead to multi-modal noise
	 distributions, for which few solutions exist to date. Our approach
	 circumvents cumbersome a-priori calibration, allows for rapid
	 deployment in unknown environments, and facilitates adaptation to
	 changing conditions. Our first contribution is a generalization of the
	 classical multidimensional scaling algorithm to account for
	 measurements that have multi-modal error distributions. Our second
	 contribution is an online approach that iterates between node
	 localization and noise parameter estimation. We validate our method in
	 3-dimensional networks, (i) through simulation to test the sensitivity
	 of the algorithm on its design parameters, and (ii) through physical
	 experimentation in a NLOS environment. Our setup uses UWB devices that
	 provide time-of-flight measurements, which can lead to positively
	 biased distance measurements in NLOS conditions. We show that our
	 algorithm converges to accurate position estimates, even when initial
	 position estimates are very uncertain, initial error models are

We present SurePoint, a system for drop-in, high-fidelity indoor localization.
SurePoint builds on recently available commercial ultra-wideband radio hardware.
While ultra-wideband radio hardware can provide the timing primitives necessary
for a simple adaptation of two-way ranging, we show that with the addition of
frequency and spatial diversity, we can achieve a 53\% decrease in median
ranging error.
Because this extra diversity requires many additional packets for each range
estimate, we next develop an efficient broadcast ranging protocol for
localization that ameliorates this overhead.
We evaluate the performance of this ranging protocol in stationary and
fast-moving environments and find that it achieves up to 0.08\,m median error
and 0.53\,m 99th percentile error.
As ranging requires the tag to have exclusive access to the channel, we next
develop a protocol to coordinate the localization of multiple tags in space.
This protocol builds on recent work exploiting the constructive interference
phenomenon. The ultra-wideband PHY uses a different modulation scheme
compared to the narrowband PHY used by previous work, thus we first explore the
viability and performance of constructive interference with ultra-wideband
radios.
Finally, as the ranging protocol requires careful management of the
ultra-wideband radio and tight timing, we develop TriPoint, a dedicated
``drop-in'' ranging module that provides a simple \iic interface. We show that
this additional microcontroller demands only marginal energy overhead while
facilitating interoperability by freeing the primary microcontroller to
handle other tasks.

We introduce \emph{Harmonium}, a novel ultra-wideband RF localization architecture
that achieves decimeter-scale accuracy indoors.
Harmonium strikes a balance between tag simplicity and processing complexity to
provide fast and accurate indoor location estimates.
Harmonium uses only commodity components and consists of a small, inexpensive,
lightweight, and FCC-compliant ultra-wideband transmitter or \emph{tag}, fixed
infrastructure \emph{anchors} with known locations, and centralized processing
that calculates the tag's position.
Anchors employ a new frequency-stepped narrowband receiver architecture that
rejects narrowband interferers and
extracts high-resolution timing information without the cost or complexity of
traditional ultra-wideband approaches.
In a complex indoor environment, 90\% of position estimates obtained with
Harmonium exhibit less than 31\,cm of error with an average 9\,cm of inter-sample
noise. In non-line-of-sight conditions (i.e. through-wall), 90\% of position error is less than
42\,cm.
The tag draws 75\,mW when actively transmitting, or 3.9\,mJ per location fix
at the 19\,Hz update rate.  Tags weigh 3\,g and cost \$4.50\,USD at modest
volumes.
Harmonium introduces a new design point for indoor localization
and enables localization of small, fast objects such as micro quadrotors,
devices previously restricted to expensive optical motion capture
systems.

    Power meters are critical for submetering loads in residential and commercial settings, but high installation cost and complexity hamper their broader adoption. Recent approaches address installation burdens by proposing non-invasive meters that easily clip onto a wire, or stick onto a circuit breaker, to perform contactless metering. Unfortunately, these designs require regular maintenance (e.g.\ battery replacement) or reduce measurement accuracy (e.g.\ work poorly with non-unity power factors). This paper presents Gemini, a new design point in the power metering space. Gemini addresses the drawbacks of prior approaches by decoupling and distributing the AC voltage and current measurement acquisitions, and recombining them wirelessly using a low-bandwidth approach, to offer non-invasive real, reactive, and apparent power metering. Battery maintenance is eliminated by using an energy-harvesting design that enables the meter to power itself using a current transformer. Accuracy is substantially improved over other non-invasive meters by virtualizing the voltage channel---effectively allowing the meter to calculate power as if it could directly measure voltage (since true power requires sample-by-sample multiplication of current and voltage measurements acquired with tight timing constraints). Collectively, these improvements result in a new design point that meters resistive loads with 0.6\,W average error and a range of reactive and switching loads with 2.2\,W average error---matching commercial, mains-powered solutions.

			information in the mere existence of a radio transmission, rather than the
			contents of that transmission. A sensor consisting simply of a radio and an
			energy-harvesting power supply tuned to harvest a side-channel emission of
			energy consumption (e.g. light, heat, magnetic field, vibration) will
			exhibit an activation frequency that is correlated with the power draw of the
			load to which it is affixed. These sensors report their activations to the
			data-processing backend, which can determine the actual power draw by
			incorporating ground truth aggregate measurements such as those provided by
			utility meters. The server maps sensor activations to energy consumption by observing
			when the aggregate measurement and the sensor activation frequency change simultaneously.
			The server iteratively partitions the system history into discrete states which are
			used to construct and solve instances of a linear optimization problem. Solutions
			to the problem reveal the mapping from pulse frequencies to individual load power draw.
			This systems approach to submetering results in deployments that are easy to
			install and maintain, while contributing zero additional load, enabling building
			owners and occupants to simply affix tags to energy consumers and automatically begin
			receiving real-time power draw readings.

			systems. However, existing devices are bulky, measuring
			$>$~1\,cm$^3$, and they are hampered by short lifetimes and
			fail to realize the ``smart dust'' vision of~[1]. Smart
			dust requires a mm$^3$-scale, wireless sensor node with
			perpetual energy harvesting. Recently two
			application-specific implantable microsystems~[2][3]
			demonstrated the potential of a mm$^3$-scale system in

			assembly and deployment and the need for flexible
			design to enable use in multiple application domains.
			To this end, we propose a 1.0\,mm$^3$ general-purpose
			heterogeneous sensor node platform with a stackable
			multi-layer structure that includes a new, ultra-low
			power I$^2$C (Inter-Integrated Circuit) interface for
			inter-layer communication. The system has an
			ultra-low-power optical wakeup receiver and GOC (Global
					Optical Communication), which enables
			re-programming and synchronization. It also includes an
			ultra-low power PMU (Power Management Unit) with BOD
			(Brown-Out Detector) to prevent processor malfunctions
			and battery damage. The BOD also controls a POR
			(Power-On Reset) module in other layers to enable a
			proper reset sequence. Image and temperature sensors
			are implemented, but the modularity of the system
			allows end-users to easily replace or add layers to

		 power conversion, to supply the meter itself, and energy metering, to
		 measure the load consumption.  This paper presents Monjolo, a new
		 energy-metering architecture that combines these two functions to
		 yield a new design point in the metering space.  The key insight
		 underlying this work is that the output of a current transformer --
		 nominally used to measure a load current -- can be harvested and used
		 to {\em intermittently} power a wireless sensor node.  The hypothesis
		 is that the node's activation frequency increases monotonically with
		 the primary load's draw, making it possible to estimate load power
		 from the interval between activations, assuming the node consumes a
		 fixed energy quanta during each activation.  This paper explores this
		 thesis by designing, implementing, and evaluating the Monjolo
		 metering architecture.  The results demonstrate that it is possible to
		 build a meter that draws zero-power under zero-load conditions, offers
		 high accuracy for near-unity power factor loads, works with non-unity
		 power factor loads in combination with a whole-house meter, wirelessly
		 reports readings to a data aggregator, is resilient to communication
		 failures, and is parsimonious with the radio channel, even under heavy
		 loads.  Monjolo eliminates the high-voltage AC-DC power supply and AC
		 metering circuitry present in earlier designs, enabling a smaller,
		 simpler, safer, and lower-cost design point that supports novel
		 deployment scenarios like non-intrusive circuit-level metering.

existing phone peripheral interfaces by drawing all necessary power
from the microphone bias voltage, encoding all data as analog audio,

custom application) for continuous data collection.
These properties make the AudioDAQ design more universal, so it works
across a broad range of phones including sophisticated smart phones
and simpler feature phones, enables simple analog peripherals without
requiring a microcontroller, requires no hardware or software
modifications on the phone itself, uses significantly less power than
prior approaches, and allows continuous data capture over an extended
period of time. The AudioDAQ design is efficient because it draws all
necessary power from the microphone bias voltage, and it is general
because this voltage and a voice memo application are present on most
mobile phones in use today.  We show the viability of our architecture
by evaluating an end-to-end system that can capture EKG signals
continuously for hours and send the data to the cloud for storage,
processing, and visualization.},
