Posters
=======

Poster support is only partially implemented currently. Right now it will
simply display posters in the sidebar if a pdf is put in this folder. I intend
to add support for linking to actually published posters in an intelligent way
as well as some indication of the venue for non-published posters.

How to add your poster
----------------------

**DO NOT USE MAC TO CONVERT YOUR PPTX TO PDF -- DO NOT!**

1.) Open your poster in powerpoint on a WINDOWS machine.
2.) Choose 'Save As' and select '.pdf'
3.) Check the 'Save for web' checkbox
4.) Double-check that you did (3) correctly
5.) Put a copy of the pdf named venueYYproject.pdf in this folder
6.) Check that the pdf is small-ish in size (that you did (3) correctly and did
    not do this on a mac. Powerpoint on a mac _cannot_ save for web correctly,
    so please do not try).
