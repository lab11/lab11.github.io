<p>Harmonia seeks the best of both worlds, leveraging affordable, low-energy

<p>Harmonia is designed as an assymetric <em>tag</em> and <em>anchor</em> system. Lightweight,
low-cost, low-energy, low-complexity tags are distributed in free space.
These tags mix the output of a narrowband radio with a square wave to generate
a UWB signal. Anchor nodes with a highly tunable narrowband frontend quickly
sweep the spectrum and stitch together samples to form one, unified UWB
capture.</p>

measure the load consumption.  This paper presents Monjolo, a new
energy-metering architecture that combines these two functions to
yield a new design point in the metering space.</p>
<p>The key insight
underlying this work is that the output of a current transformer --
nominally used to measure a load current -- can be harvested and used
to <em>intermittently</em> power a wireless sensor node.  The hypothesis
is that the node's activation frequency increases monotonically with
the primary load's draw, making it possible to estimate load power
from the interval between activations, assuming the node consumes a
fixed energy quanta during each activation.  This paper explores this
thesis by designing, implementing, and evaluating the Monjolo
metering architecture.</p>

<p class="lead">"By about 2020 software radios will have become the standard technology for
commercial, as well as military, radios, employed in a range of devices, from
battery-powered sensors and hand-held devices to plugged-in devices (such as
base stations)," claims BBN's Craig Partridge in the September 2011 issue of
CACM. However, one of the chief impediments to realizing this future is that
today's software radios are large, expensive, and power-hungry, and so they're
poorly-suited to battery-power and hand-held devices. This project explores
clean-slate system architectures for software-defined radios, ranging from
highly-programmble radios to RF front-ends with reconfigurable hardware
baseband processing to simple RF front-ends with pure software baseband
processing. The key challenge is how to define, describe, and partition the
computations that occur across electronics (e.g. filters), hardware (e.g.
verilog), and software (e.g. C/C++) to maximize efficiency and resource
utilization. Our chief aim is to make software radios small, inexpensive, and
low-power. Today, we have an 802.15.4-compatible SDR platform that's just 3"x5"
and costs around $100. It will soon be an open platform for other researchers,
and it will allow us to explore the range of architectural tradeoffs necessary

		<h2 class="featurette-heading">EKG Sensor. <span class="small">The mobile phone as a medical instrument.</span></h2>
<p class="lead">We believe that any hospital,
village clinic, or doctor can have access to advanced health care instruments
like an EKG monitor for little more than the cost of a mobile phone.</p>
<p>Health care facilities in developed countries have access to a large number of
medical instruments unavailable to health care professionals in the developing
world. One example of such an instrument is the EKG monitor. EKG signals are
used to diagnose a wide range of medical conditions but they are often
unavailable in all but the most advanced hospitals in developing countries like
India, Ghana etc.  We aim to
design a low-power, low-cost EKG monitor that uses the "HiJack" platform for
interfacing between the EKG sensor peripheral and the mobile phone, and the
mobile phone for visualizing the ECG waveform.</p>
