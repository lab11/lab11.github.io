			<pre>Traditional embedded systems rely on custom C code deployed in a monolithic firmware image. In these systems, all code must be trusted completely, as any code can directly modify memory or hardware registers. More recently, some embedded OSes have improved security by separating userspace applications from the kernel, using strong hardware isolation in the form of a memory protection unit (MPU). Unfortunately, this design requires either a large trusted computing base (TCB) containing all OS services, or moving many OS services into userspace. The large TCB approach offers no protection against seemingly-correct backdoored code, discouraging the use of kernel code produced by others and complicating security audits. OS services in userspace come at a cost to usability and efficiency. We posit that a model enabling two tiers of trust for kernel code is better suited to modern embedded software practices. In this paper, we present the threat model of the Tock Operating System, which is based on this idea. We compare this threat model to existing security approaches, and show how it provides useful guarantees to different stakeholders.</pre>

			<pre>We explore the challenges of implementing a privacy-preserving opportunistic data collection network for resource-constrained edge IoT devices. Opportunistic networks require no fixed infrastructure and allow edge devices to piggy-back messages through stationary or mobile gateways. Research interest in such networks has waxed and waned over the years, but commercial deployments have not taken off until recently. Over the past year, we have witnessed a resurgence of interest fueled by wide-scale commercial deployments, most notably Amazon's Sidewalk network, but also Apple's Find My and the Tile network. As these networks become more prevalent, maintaining the privacy of the individuals who participate in them will become increasingly important. In this paper, we demonstrate that current opportunistic networks leak access patterns to the network operator itself through communication metadata, which can be used to reconstruct location traces. We argue that opportunistic networks and privacy are not mutually exclusive, and suggest some potential research directions to strengthen the privacy properties of these networks. Since opportunistic networks are now being deployed at massive scale, we argue that the time is ripe to make them privacy-preserving before it is too late.</pre>

			<pre>Smart space technologies have entered the mainstream home market. Most users currently interact with smart homes that they (or an acquaintance) have set up and know well. However, as these technologies spread to commercial or public environments, users will need to frequently interact with unfamiliar smart spaces where they are unaware of the available capabilities and the system maintainer will not be present to help. Users will need to quickly and independently 1) discover what is and is not possible, and 2) make use of available functionality. Widespread adoption of smart space systems will not be possible until this discoverability issue is solved. We design and evaluate ARticulate, an interface that allows users to have successful smart space interactions with an intelligent assistant while learning transferable information about the overall set of devices in an unfamiliar space. Our method of using Snapchat-like contextual photo messages enhanced by two technologies---augmented reality and autocomplete---allows users to determine available functionality and achieve their goals in one attempt with a smart space they have never seen before, something no existing interface supports. The ability to easily operate unfamiliar smart spaces improves the usability of existing systems and removes a significant obstacle to the vision of ubiquitous computing.</pre>

			<pre>As the Internet of Things (IoT) has grown more prevalent, the gateway has become a critical linchpin of IoT network architectures. To bring constrained embedded devices online, Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE) has proven to be particularly popular for the low power sensors and actuators pervasive in the consumer IoT market. And yet, the gateways that facilitate cloud connectivity for such devices incur burdensome time, cost, and unreliability. This problem persists because current gateways conflate many application-specific functions, which continues to fuel the trend of requiring separate expensive, custom, and over-provisioned solutions for each brand or class of device to establish reliable network connectivity. One route to address the problem is the over-provisioned gateways at the heart of Apple and Google's smart home offerings. Another approach involves adding ephemeral gateway functions on pervasive connected devices like smartphones. In this paper, we explore a third approach that strips the gateway down to its bare essentials and eliminates the rest. We test the approach on the Espressif ESP32, a \$3 microcontroller that contains built-in Wi-Fi and BLE radios, with a deployment of low-power IoT devices, evaluating the performance, drawbacks, and tradeoffs. Our results suggest that this is a promising technique for cost-sensitive applications with low deployment densities and aggregate data rates, but more capable design points may be preferred as these assumptions are relaxed.</pre>

			<pre>In many engineering disciplines such as circuit board, chip, and mechanical design, a hardware description language (HDL) approach provides important benefits over direct manipulation interfaces by supporting concepts like abstraction and generator meta-programming. While several such HDLs have emerged recently and promised power and flexibility, they also present challenges – especially to designers familiar with current graphical workflows. In this work, we investigate an IDE approach to provide a graphical editor for a board-level circuit design HDL. Unlike GUI builders which convert an entire diagram to code, we instead propose generating equivalent HDL from individual graphical edit actions. By keeping code as the primary design input, we preserve the full power of the underlying HDL, while remaining useful even to advanced users. We discuss our concept, design considerations such as performance, system implementation, and report on the results of an exploratory remote user study with four experienced hardware designers. </pre>

			<pre>In much of the world, electricity grids are not instrumented at the customer level, limiting insights into the power quality experienced by utility customers. Moreover, to understand grid performance, regulators and investors must depend on utilities to self-report reliability data. To address these challenges, we introduce PowerWatch, an agile methodology to directly measure customer experience and aggregated grid performance without relying on the utility for deployment or management. PowerWatch employs a system of distributed sensors coupled with cloud-based analytics. We evaluate the PowerWatch methodology by deploying 462 sensors in homes and businesses in Accra, Ghana for over a year, yielding the largest open-source data set on electricity reliability at the customer-level in the region. We describe the architecture, design, and performance of PowerWatch, as well as the data that are collected, explaining how we determine the accuracy and coverage of our methodology without ground truth. Finally, we report on grid performance issues, finding nearly twice as many outages as the utility observed, suggesting a need for better grid performance monitoring.</pre>

			<pre>Office-based workplaces are an important but understudied context for infectious disease transmission. We examined the feasibility of two different sensors (Opos and Bluetooth beacons) for collecting person-to-person contacts and hand hygiene in office-based workplaces. Opo is an interaction sensor that captures sensor-to-sensor interactions through ultrasonic frequencies, which correspond to face-to-face contacts between study participants. Opos were additionally used to measure hand hygiene events by affixing sensors to soap and alcohol-based hand sanitizer dispensers. Bluetooth beacons were used in conjunction with a smartphone application and recorded proximity contacts between study participants. Participants in two office sites were followed for one-week in their workplace in March 2018. Contact patterns varied by time of day and day of the week. Face-to-face contacts were of shorter mean duration than proximity contacts. Supervisors had fewer proximity contacts but more face-to-face contacts than non-supervisors. Self-reported hand hygiene was substantively higher than sensor-collected hand hygiene events and duration of hand washing events was short (median: 9 seconds, range: 2.5–33 seconds). Given that office settings are key environments in which working age populations spend a large proportion of their time and interactions, a better characterization of empirical social networks and hand hygiene behaviors for workplace interactions are needed to mitigate outbreaks and prepare for pandemics. Our study demonstrates that implementing sensor technologies for tracking interactions and behaviors in offices is feasible and can provide new insights into real-world social networks and hygiene practices. We identified key social interactions, variability in hand hygiene, and differences in interactions by workplace roles. High-resolution network data will be essential for identifying the most effective ways to mitigate infectious disease transmission and develop pandemic preparedness plans for the workplace setting.</pre>

			<pre>Mainstream board-level circuit design tools work at the lowest level of design --- schematics and individual components. While novel tools experiment with higher levels of design, abstraction often comes at the expense of the fine-grained control afforded by low-level tools. In this work, we propose a hardware description language (HDL) approach that supports users at multiple levels of abstraction from broad system architecture to subcircuits and component selection. We extend the familiar hierarchical block diagram with polymorphism to include abstract-typed blocks (e.g., generic resistor supertype) and electronics modeling (i.e., currents and voltages). Such an approach brings the advantages of reusability and encapsulation from object-oriented programming, while addressing the unique needs of electronics designers such as physical correctness verification. We discuss the system design, including fundamental abstractions, the block diagram construction HDL, and user interfaces to inspect and fine-tune the design; demonstrate example designs built with our system; and present feedback from intermediate-level engineers who have worked with our system.</pre>

			<pre>Social scientists, psychologists, and epidemiologists use empirical human interaction data to research human behaviour, social bonding, and disease spread. Historically, systems measuring interactions have been forced to choose between deployability and measurement fidelity---they operate only in instrumented spaces, under line-of-sight conditions, or provide coarse-grained proximity data. We introduce SociTrack, a platform for autonomous social interaction tracking via wireless distance measurements. Deployments require no supporting infrastructure and provide sub-second, decimeter-accurate ranging information over multiple days. The key insight that enables both deployability and fidelity in one system is to decouple node mobility and network management from range measurement, which results in a novel dual-radio architecture. SociTrack leverages an energy-efficient and scalable ranging protocol that is accurate to 14.8 cm (99th percentile) in complex indoor environments and allows our prototype to operate for 12 days on a 2000 mAh battery. Finally, to validate its deployability and efficacy, SociTrack is used by early childhood development researchers to capture caregiver-infant interactions.</pre>

Governments around the world have become increasingly frustrated with tech giants dictating public
health policy. The software created by Apple and Google enables individuals to track their own potential
exposure through collated exposure notifications. However, the same software prohibits location tracking,
denying key information needed by public health officials for robust contract tracing. This information
is needed to treat and isolate COVID-19 positive people, identify transmission hotspots, and protect
against continued spread of infection. In this article, we present two simple ideas: the lighthouse and the
covid-commons that address the needs of public health authorities while preserving the privacy-sensitive
goals of the Apple and Google exposure notification protocols.

Existing work has experimented with approaches like circuit synthesis, functional characterization, or fine grained physical modeling. Each of these approaches augment the design process as it exists today, with its fundamental split between various levels of abstraction. We notice that hierarchical block diagrams can capture both high-level system structure as well as fine grained physical connectivity, and use that symmetry to construct a model for electronic circuits that can span the entire design process.

As the number of Internet of Things devices continue to
grow, a pattern of off-loading user control and interaction to
individuals’ mobile devices has emerged. The user experience,
however, is burdened by high-friction tasks, including device
discovery, app installation, scanning, pairing, and configuration. 
Additionally, the tools and systems currently employed
to facilitate interaction vary in degree of usefulness, provide
inconsistent support, and fail to mesh together in a meaningful way. 
This user experience model scales poorly with the
increasing population of “things”, and significantly hinders
casual interactions with ambient devices, as well as regular
interactions with persistent devices. To break away from this
restrictive paradigm, we propose an architecture that provides
a seamless, scalable approach to discovering and interacting
with nearby “things” in both short- and long-term contexts.
The system takes advantage of multiple network patterns and
modern web technologies to supply users with rich device
interfaces that can interact directly over local networking protocols. 
A mobile app-based implementation of this system is
tested with several embedded wireless devices. In our analysis, 
we find that our method scales better than current popular
models and that it enables powerful and complex functionality
while remaining natural, intuitive, and secure for users.

Low-power wide-area networks (LPWANs) are a compelling answer to the
networking challenges faced by many Internet of Things devices. Their
combination of low power, long range, and deployment ease has motivated a
flurry of research, including exciting results on backscatter and
interference cancellation that further lower power budgets and increase
capacity. But despite the interest, we argue that unlicensed LPWAN
technologies can only serve a narrow class of Internet of Things
applications due to two principal challenges: capacity and coexistence.

We propose a metric, bit flux, to describe networks and applications in
terms of throughput over a coverage area. Using bit flux, we find that the
combination of low bit rate and long range restricts the use case of LPWANs
to sparse sensing applications. Furthermore, this lack of capacity leads
networks to use as much available bandwidth as possible, and a lack of
coexistence mechanisms causes poor performance in the presence of multiple,
independently-administered networks. We discuss a variety of techniques and
approaches that could be used to address these two challenges and enable
LPWANs to achieve the promise of ubiquitous connectivity.

The vision of sensor systems that collect critical and previously ungathered
information about the world is often only realized when sensors, students,
and subjects move outside the academic laboratory. However, deployments at
even the smallest scales introduce complexities and risks that can be
difficult for a research team to anticipate. Over the past year, our
interdisciplinary team of engineers and economists has been designing,
deploying, and operating a large sensor network in Accra, Ghana that
measures power outages and quality at households and firms. This network
consists of 457 custom sensors, over 3,000 mobile app instances,
thousands of participant surveys, and custom user incentive and
deployment management systems. In part, this deployment supports an
evaluation of the impacts of investments in the grid on reliability and
the subsequent effects of improvements in reliability on
socioeconomic well-being. We report our experiences as we move from
performing small pilot deployments to our current scale, attempting to
identify the pain points at each stage of the deployment. Finally, we
extract high-level observations and lessons learned from our
deployment activities, which we wish we had originally known when
forecasting budgets, human resources, and project timelines. These
insights will be critical as we look toward scaling our deployment to the
en-tire city of Accra and beyond, and we hope that they will encourage and
support other researchers looking to measure highly granular information
about our world’s critical systems.

Printed Circuit Board (PCB) design tools are critical in helping users build non-trivial electronics devices. 
While recent work recognizes deficiencies with current tools and explores novel methods, little has been done to understand modern designers and their needs.
To gain better insight into their practices, we interview fifteen electronics designers of a variety of backgrounds. 
Our open-ended, semi-structured interviews examine both overarching design flows and details of individual steps. 
One major finding was that most creative engineering work happens during system architecture, yet current tools operate at lower abstraction levels and create significant tedious work for designers.
From that insight, we conceptualize abstractions and primitives for higher-level tools and elicit feedback from our participants on clickthrough mockups of design flows through an example project. 
We close with our observation on opportunities for improving board design tools and discuss generalizability of our findings beyond the electronics domain.

Today, most sensors that harvest energy from indoor solar, ambient RF, or
thermal gradients buffer small amounts of energy in capacitors as they
intermittently work through a sensing task. While the utilization of
capacitors for energy storage affords these systems indefinite lifetimes,
their low energy capacity necessitates complex intermittent programming models
for state retention and energy management. However, recent advances in
battery technology lead us to reevaluate the impact that increased energy
storage capacity may have on the necessity of these programming models
and the reliability of energy harvesting sensors. In this paper, we
propose a capacity-based framework to help structure energy harvesting
sensor design, analyze the impact of capacity on key reliability metrics
using a data-driven simulation, and consider how backup energy storage
alters the design space. We find that for many designs that utilize solar
energy harvesting, increasing energy storage capacity to 1-10 mWh can
obviate the need for intermittent programming techniques, augment the
total harvested energy by 1.4-2.3x, and improve the availability of a
sensor by 1.3-2.6x. We also show that a hybrid design using energy
harvesting with a secondary-cell battery and a backup primary-cell
battery can achieve 2-4x the lifetime of primary-cell only designs while
eliminating the failure modes present in energy harvesting systems.
Finally, we implement an indoor, solar energy harvesting sensor based on
our analysis and find that its behavior aligns with our simulation’s
predictions.

Long the case in automotive, aeronautics, and industrial settings, embedded
systems in myriad other areas are becoming distributed systems in all but
name. Driven by increasingly complex applications with wide-ranging
hardware requirements, developers are turning to modular designs that
integrate multiple processors onto a single board. Unfortunately,
problems already familiar to distributed systems—coordinated execution,
portable applications, and unified system-wide administration—have no
corresponding embedded support and must be re-implemented in an ad hoc
fashion for each application. We argue that future embedded operating
system development should explicitly support these multi-microcontroller
systems, and can leverage distributed techniques to do so. We also
believe that the low-level nature of embedded sensing indicates that OSes
should not attempt to completely abstract the presence of separate
hardware components and capabilities. Instead, they should provide useful
interfaces that support resource-constrained execution and modular
application interactions. To that end, we identify existing embedded OS
efforts and distributed systems concepts that can inform next-generation
OS development.

The Internt of Things (IoT) is a rapidly evolving application space. One
of the fascinating new fields in IoT research is mm-scale sensors, which
make up a myriad of new application domains. Enabled by the unique
characteristics of cyber-physical systems and recent advances in low-power
design and bare-die 3D chip stacking, mm-scale sensors are rapidly becoming
a reality. In this paper, we will survey the challenges and solutions to
3D-stacked mm-scale design, highlighting low-power circuit issues ranging
from low-power SRAM and miniature neural network accelerators to radio
communication protocols and analog interfaces. We will discuss system-level
challenges and illustrate several complete systems and their merging
applicaiton spaces.

The smartphone is an incredible computing platform. Loaded with powerful processing, vast data storage, near-global connectivity, built-in batteries, and a rich array of sensors, these devices reliably service the needs of billions of users every day. However, when tasked to run just a single application continuously without any human interaction, the smartphone platform becomes surprisingly unreliable. Over the course of a four-month deployment of Android-phone-based cellular gateways in Zanzibar, Tanzania, all 16 deployed phones failed despite significant engineering efforts, and six phones became physically damaged. This article examines what went wrong and how mobile computing platforms could adapt to support more traditional embedded computing roles and workloads.

With the current augmented reality and low-power radio technology present on
mobile platforms, we can imagine a standard and physically tangible browsing
mechanism for objects in the Web of Things. We explore a model for user
interaction with IoT devices that makes use of mobile augmented reality to allow
users to identify new devices or easily access regularly-used devices in their
environment, enables immediate interaction with quickly-obtainable user
interfaces from the web, and provides developers a convenient platform to
display custom interfaces for their devices. This model represents a step
towards software-based interaction that might, one day, feel as intuitive,
accessible, and familiar as the physical interfaces we commonly encounter in our
daily lives.

One of the largest impediments to pervasive sensing is ensuring equally
pervasive network access. While we can create wireless sensors that last for
years without human intervention, the network infrastructure to support their
deployment requires planning, power, and maintenance. The potential for a
crowd-based solution to this problem is ripe—ever pervasive smart phones have
the hardware and connectivity to serve as ubiquitous mobile gateways—however
the fragmentation of low power wireless protocols combined with the lack of
incentive for users to sacrifice their own resources transporting others’
data has made this approach untenable.

Through an “off label” use of Google’s Physical Web and Nearby Notifications,
it was possible to ignore these problems and exploit nearly the entire global
population of Android phones to slowly transport sensor data to an arbitrary
web server. This mechanism was enabled by default and transparent to the
phone’s user. On one hand, it served as an exciting opportunity to explore
infrastructure-free wireless networking. In a one week deployment of five
devices transmitting at 1 Hz, we were able to successfully transport 326 kB
of data with an average data rate of 0.1–2.6 bps. This is slow, but
sufficient for many applications such as environmental monitoring and sensor
status reporting. On the other hand, a mobile operating system probably
should not have enabled exfiltration of arbitrary data without a user’s
knowledge or consent. While Nearby Notifications has now been decommissioned,
we examine security policy requirements for future systems that interact with
nearby devices, and we envision a similar, intentional mechanism to allow
data hitchhiking for the Internet of Things.

Incentives are a key facet of human studies research, yet the state-of-the-art
often designs and implements incentive systems in an ad-hoc, on-demand manner.
We introduce the first vocabulary for formally describing incentive
systems and develop a software infrastructure that enables UI-based graphical
generation of complex, auditable, reliable, and reproducible incentive systems.
We call this infrastructure the Open INcentive Kit (OINK).
A review of recent literature from several communities finds that of the one hundred and twenty-one publications that incorporate
incentives, only thirty-one describe their incentive system in detail, and all of these could be implemented using OINK. We evaluate OINK in practice by using it for an active energy monitoring deployment in Ghana and find that OINK successfully facilitates thousands of individual incentive payments. Finally, we describe our efforts to generalize OINK for different research communities, specifically focusing on architectural decisions around extensibility to support unanticipated use cases. OINK is free and open-source software.

In 2015, we performed a study to learn which Bluetooth Low Energy peripheral
devices were most prevalent among consumers, as well as which services these
devices provided and utilized in practice. Additionally, we sought to
investigate the real-world usage of standard Bluetooth services versus custom
protocols among developers. The study involved a continuous month-long scan
taken on two floors of an academic building. The resulting dataset consists of
scan results from approximately 3000 unique devices.

When performing RF ranging in a complex indoor environment, the error of a
single channel estimate can vary widely. A key insight of the PolyPoint and
SurePoint ranging protocols is that individual nodes can efficiently capture
multiple independent samples of the RF channel. For each point in space, nodes
capture twenty seven independent samples by varying the spectrum sampled and
the polarization of antennas. This dataset includes all of the measurements
reported in the PolyPoint and SurePoint papers, which comprises several
thousand points in a complex indoor environment. Precise 3D coordinates of
nodes were captured using an optical motion capture system calibrated to
millimeter accuracy. Several tracking studies are included, with continuous
samples over time as a node moves through the environment.

For the past decade, the status-quo for energy harvesting sensors has been to
buffer small amounts of energy in capacitors to in- termittently work through
a sensing task. While using capacitors for storage offers these systems
indefinite lifetime, it comes at a cost – they must tolerate the decreased
availability, lower en- ergy utilization, and more complex programming models
inherent to a volatile, intermittent design. We argue that many of these
problems stem from insufficient energy storage and could be elimi- nated with
the use of batteries. Recent advances in rechargeable battery technology
weaken the historical arguments against their use. We believe that using
batteries in energy harvesting sensors will push us closer to a class of
reliable, general purpose devices that can better serve human-centric sensing
applications than their capacitor-based counterparts at the cost of having a
finite, but long, lifetime.</pre>

Smart and connected devices offer enormous potential to enable
context-aware, localized, and multi-device orchestrations that could
substantially increase the reach and utility of computing.  The growth
of these applications has been hampered, however, as devices, their
data, and their control have been largely sequestered to their own
vendor-specific APIs, clouds, and applications---a largely stove-piped
state of affairs.  In instances where barriers between devices have
been pierced, the connections often occur between vendor clouds,
affecting the latency, privacy, and reliability of the original
application, while simultaneously making them more complex.  Locally
executing applications have not materialized as devices with
incompatible communication protocols, inconsistent APIs, and
incongruent data models rarely communicate. We claim that what is
needed to unlock the application potential is an architecture tailored
to facilitating applications composed of networked devices.

Our proposed architecture addresses this by providing a port-based abstraction
for devices using a small wrapper layer. This device abstraction
provides a consistent view of devices, and embeddable runtimes provide existing
applications straightforward access to devices. The architecture also supports
device discovery, shared interfaces between devices, and an application
specification interface that promotes creating device-agnostic applications
capable of operating even when devices change.  We demonstrate the efficacy of
our architecture with two application case studies that highlight the
abstraction layers between applications and devices and employ the
embeddability of our system to add new functionality to existing systems.

Network connectivity is often one of the most challenging aspects of deploying
sensors. In many countries, cellular networks provide the most reliable,
highest bandwidth, and greatest coverage option for internet access. While this makes smartphones a seemingly ideal platform to serve as a gateway between sensors and the cloud,
we find that a device designed for
multi-tenant operation and frequent human interaction becomes unreliable
when tasked to continuously run a single application with no human
interaction, a seemingly counter-intuitive result. Further, we find that economy phones cannot physically
withstand continuous operation, resulting in a surprisingly high rate of
permanent device failures in the field. If these observations hold more broadly, they would make mobile phones
poorly suited to a range of sensing applications for which they have been
rumored to hold great promise.

The world’s population is flocking to city centers at an increasing rate,
testing the ability of urban planners and local governments to address new
problems in transportation, waste disposal, urban health, and public
safety. While one could imagine solutions enabled by an emerging class of
smart sensors, current attempts at such systems are difficult to deploy and
single purpose in their design. If we expect researchers and
citizen-scientists to participate in the data-driven rejuvenation of our
urban spaces (and we should, since they are the ones experiencing the
day-to-day problems), we must lower the bar to deploying sensors
and accessing smart-city data. Towards this goal, we present Signpost, an
infrastructure-free sensing platform that aims to enable easy, multi-use
sensor deployments for citizens, and researchers who have little expertise
in building smart and connected sensors.

We introduce \emph{Harmonium}, a novel ultra-wideband RF localization architecture
that achieves decimeter-scale accuracy indoors.
Harmonium strikes a balance between tag simplicity and processing complexity to
provide fast and accurate indoor location estimates.
Harmonium uses only commodity components and consists of a small, inexpensive,
lightweight, and FCC-compliant ultra-wideband transmitter or \emph{tag}, fixed
infrastructure \emph{anchors} with known locations, and centralized processing
that calculates the tag's position.
Anchors employ a new frequency-stepped narrowband receiver architecture that
rejects narrowband interferers and
extracts high-resolution timing information without the cost or complexity of
traditional ultra-wideband approaches.
In a complex indoor environment, 90\% of position estimates obtained with
Harmonium exhibit less than 31\,cm of error with an average of 9\,cm of inter-sample
noise.
In non-line-of-sight conditions (i.e. through-wall), 90\% of position error is
less than 42\,cm.
The tag draws 75\,mW when actively transmitting, or 3.9\,mJ per location fix
at the 19\,Hz update rate.  Tags weigh 3\,g and cost \$4.50\,USD at modest
volumes.
Furthermore, VLSI-based design concepts are identified for a simple, low-power
realization of the Harmonium tag to offer a roadmap for the realization of Harmonium
concepts in future integrated systems.
Harmonium introduces a new design point for indoor localization
and enables localization of small, fast objects such as micro quadrotors,
devices previously restricted to expensive optical motion capture
systems.

City-scale sensing holds the promise of enabling deeper insight into how our
urban environments function. Applications such as observing air quality and
measuring traffic flows can have powerful impacts, allowing city
planners and citizen scientists alike to understand and improve their world.
However, the path from conceiving applications to implementing them is fraught with difficulty.
A successful city-scale deployment requires physical installation, power
management, and communications---all challenging tasks standing between a good
idea and a realized one.

The Signpost platform, presented at IPSN 2018, has been created 
to address these challenges. Signpost
enables easy deployment by relying on harvested, solar energy and wireless
networking rather than their wired counterparts. To further lower the bar
to deploying applications, the platform provides the key resources necessary
to support its pluggable sensor modules in their distributed sensing tasks. 
In this demo, we present the Signpost hardware and
several applications running on a deployment of Signposts on UC Berkeley's campus,
including distributed, energy-adaptive traffic monitoring and 
fine grained weather reporting. Additionally we show the cloud infrastructure
supporting the Signpost deployment, specifically the ability to push new
applications and parameters down to existing sensors, with the goal of demonstrating that 
the existing deployment can serve as a future testbed.

The U.S. Federal Government and commercial partners have identified a critical gap in today's measurement technology---the ability to accurately, inexpensively, and wirelessly submeter building electricity usage at the circuit-level. Such metering technology would enable building owners, operators, and occupants to characterize and curtail electricity use in buildings---a major cost and source of carbon emissions today. Existing circuit-level metering systems are too costly to deploy, due to difficult installation or cumbersome calibration processes, too inaccurate, due to an inability to faithfully calculate power from synchronized current and voltage channels, or too unreliable, due to a strong dependence on a frequently lossy wireless channel. We propose Triumvi, a standalone, self-powered, non-contact, true-power metering system to help make circuit-level metering affordable, accurate, and reliable---in short, usable. In a splitcore current transformer form factor, Triumvi harvests energy to power itself, monitors current and voltage, calculates power, encrypts data, and wirelessly transmits the results. Our prototype can sustain a sample rate of nearly 0.5\,Hz when the load draws at least 360\,W and exhibits an average error of 4.3\% over a load power draw range of 150--600\,W. Triumvi also supports rapid installation, incremental upgrades, metering three phase and high current loads, charge sharing between between meters, and current waveform analysis, creating a highly flexible metering system capable of energy audits, industrial equipment monitoring, and many applications in-between.

Ultra wideband technology has shown great promise for providing
high-quality location estimation, even in complex indoor multipath
environments, but existing ultra wideband systems require tens to hundreds of
milliwatts during operation.
%
Backscatter communication has demonstrated the viability of astonishingly
low-power tags, but has thus far been restricted to
narrowband systems with low localization resolution.
%
The challenge to combining these complimentary technologies is that they
share a compounding limitation, constrained transmit power. Regulations limit
ultra wideband transmissions to just -41.3\,dBm/MHz, and a backscatter device
can only reflect the power it receives.
%
The solution is long-term integration of this limited power, lifting the
initially imperceptible signal out of the noise.
%
This integration only works while the target is stationary. However, stationary
describes the vast majority of objects, especially lost ones.
% especially things you are trying to find.
%
With this insight, we design Slocalization, a sub-microwatt,
decimeter-accurate localization system that opens a new tradeoff space in
localization systems and realizes an energy, size, and cost point that invites
the localization of every thing.
%
To evaluate this concept,
we implement an energy-harvesting Slocalization tag and find that
Slocalization can recover ultra wideband backscatter
in under fifteen minutes across thirty meters of space
and localize tags with a mean 3D Euclidean error of only 30\,cm.

However, stationary describes the vast majority of objects, especially lost ones. % especially things you are trying to find. % With this insight, we design Slocalization, a sub-microwatt, decimeter-accurate localization system that opens a new tradeoff space in localization systems and realizes an energy, size, and cost point that invites the localization of every thing. % To evaluate this concept, we implement an energy-harvesting Slocalization tag and find that Slocalization can recover ultra wideband backscatter in under fifteen minutes across thirty meters of space and localize tags with a mean 3D Euclidean error of only 30&nbsp;cm. </p>

City-scale sensing holds the promise of enabling a deeper understanding of our
urban environments.
However, a city-scale deployment requires physical installation,
power management, and communications---all challenging tasks standing between a
good idea and a realized one.
This indicates the need for a platform that enables easy deployment and
experimentation for applications operating at city scale.
To address these challenges, we present Signpost, a modular, energy-harvesting platform for city-scale sensing.
Signpost simplifies deployment by eliminating the need
for connection to wired infrastructure and instead harvesting energy from an
integrated solar panel. The platform furnishes the key resources necessary to
support multiple, pluggable sensor modules while providing
fair, safe, and reliable sharing in the face of dynamic energy constraints.
We deploy Signpost with several sensor modules, showing the viability
of an energy-harvesting, multi-tenant, sensing system, and evaluate its
ability to support sensing applications.
We believe Signpost reduces the difficulty inherent in city-scale deployments,
enables new experimentation, and provides improved insights into urban health.

Embedded systems have long been synonymous with special purpose, single
stakeholder computing. However, as these systems have become more capable and
the demands placed on them have become more varied and variable, embedded
software is beginning to embrace multi-tenancy.
While the general problem of supporting multiple users and processes on a
computing platform has been well explored in computer science, the
challenges of supporting multiple users with competing desires on a highly
energy-variable system remain unexplored.
On an energy-harvesting platform, incoming energy needs to be distributed
between stakeholders, and users accessing shared platform resources should
be charged for the energy use of those resources.
Furthermore, with system designers and application creators being
increasingly removed from each other, the software environments of
energy-harvesting platforms must provide primitives that enable applications
to adapt to system variability.
We explore several initial techniques for solving these problems and
demonstrate them using Signpost---a modular, energy-harvesting platform for
city-scale sensing.

microcontroller-based operating systems have not provided important
features like fault isolation, dynamic memory allocation, and
flexible concurrency. However, an emerging class of embedded
applications are software platforms, rather than single purpose

operating system for low-power platforms, takes advantage of limited
hardware-protection mechanisms as well as the type-safety features of the

for microcontrollers.  Tock isolates software faults, provides

retaining the dependability requirements of long-running applications.

With the advent of DIY smart homes and the Internet of Things comes the
emergence of user interfaces for domestic human-building interaction. However,
the design trade-offs between the different representations of a smart home’s
capabilities are still not well-understood. In this work, we examine how four
different smart home abstractions affect end users’ mental models of a
hypothetical system. We develop four questionnaires, each of which describes
the same hypothetical smart home using a different abstraction, and then we
collect responses depicting desired smart home applications from over 1,500
Mechanical Turk workers. We find that the choice of abstraction strongly primes
end users’ responses. In particular, the purely device-oriented abstraction
results in the most limited scenarios, suggesting that if we want users to
associate smart home technologies with valuable high-level applications we
should shift the UI paradigm for the Internet of Things from device-oriented
control to other abstractions that inspire a greater diversity of interactions.

			<pre>Decades of research has attempted to add safety mechanisms to
operating system kernels, but this effort has failed in most practical
systems. In particular, solutions that sacrifice performance have been
generally avoided. However, isolation techniques in modern languages can
provide safety while avoiding performance issues. Moreover, utilizing a
type-safe language with no garbage collector or other runtime services
avoids what would otherwise be some of the largest sections of trusted
code base. We report on our experiences in writing a resource efficient
embedded kernel in Rust, finding that only a small set of unsafe
abstractions are necessary in order to form common kernel building blocks.
Further, we argue that Rust's choice to avoid runtime memory management by
using a linear type system will enable the next generation of safe
operating systems.

As personal fabrication becomes increasingly accessible and popular,
a larger number of makers, many without formal training,
are dabbling in embedded and electronics design. However, existing
general-purpose, board-level circuit design techniques do not
share desirable properties of modern software development, like
rich abstraction layers and automated compiler checks, which facilitate
powerful tools that ultimately lower the barrier to entry for
programming, by allowing a higher level of design—separating specification
from implementation—and providing automated guidance
and feedback. In this paper, we present a novel methodology for
embedded design generation that allows the generation of complete
designs from high-level specifications. We present an implementation
capable of synthesizing a variety of examples to show that
our approach is viable. Starting from user-specified requirements
and a library of available components, our tool encodes the design
space as a system of constraints. Off-the-shelf solvers then reason
over these constraints to produce a block diagram containing sufficient
information to generate the finalized device firmware, bill of
materials, and circuit netlist.

We present a method for calibration-free, infrastructure-free localization
in sensor networks. Our strategy is to estimate node positions and
noise distributions of all links in the network \emph{simultaneously}
-- a strategy that has not been attempted thus far. In particular, we
account for biased, non-line-of-sight (NLOS) range measurements from
ultra-wideband (UWB) devices that lead to multi-modal noise
distributions, for which few solutions exist to date. Our approach
circumvents cumbersome a-priori calibration, allows for rapid
deployment in unknown environments, and facilitates adaptation to
changing conditions. Our first contribution is a generalization of the
classical multidimensional scaling algorithm to account for
measurements that have multi-modal error distributions. Our second
contribution is an online approach that iterates between node
localization and noise parameter estimation. We validate our method in
3-dimensional networks, (i) through simulation to test the sensitivity
of the algorithm on its design parameters, and (ii) through physical
experimentation in a NLOS environment. Our setup uses UWB devices that
provide time-of-flight measurements, which can lead to positively
biased distance measurements in NLOS conditions. We show that our
algorithm converges to accurate position estimates, even when initial
position estimates are very uncertain, initial error models are
unknown, and a significant proportion of the network links are in
NLOS.

			<pre>This paper presents a fully synthesizable low power
interconnect bus for millimeter-scale wireless sensor nodes. A
segmented ring bus topology minimizes the required chip real estate
with low input/output pad count for ultra-small form factors.  By
avoiding the conventional open drain-based solution, the bus can be
fully synthesizable. Low power is achieved by obviating a need for
local oscillators in member nodes. Also, aggressive power gating
allows low-power standby mode with only 53 gates powered on. An
integrated wakeup scheme is compatible with a power management unit
that has nW standby mode. A 3-module system including the bus is
fabricated in a 180\,nm process. The entire system consumes 8\,nW in
standby mode, and the bus achieves 17.5\,pJ/bit/chip.

We present SurePoint, a system for drop-in, high-fidelity indoor localization.
SurePoint builds on recently available commercial ultra-wideband radio hardware.
While ultra-wideband radio hardware can provide the timing primitives necessary
for a simple adaptation of two-way ranging, we show that with the addition of
frequency and spatial diversity, we can achieve a 53\% decrease in median
ranging error.
Because this extra diversity requires many additional packets for each range
estimate, we next develop an efficient broadcast ranging protocol for
localization that ameliorates this overhead.
We evaluate the performance of this ranging protocol in stationary and
fast-moving environments and find that it achieves up to 0.08\,m median error
and 0.53\,m 99th percentile error.
As ranging requires the tag to have exclusive access to the channel, we next
develop a protocol to coordinate the localization of multiple tags in space.
This protocol builds on recent work exploiting the constructive interference
phenomenon. The ultra-wideband PHY uses a different modulation scheme
compared to the narrowband PHY used by previous work, thus we first explore the
viability and performance of constructive interference with ultra-wideband
radios.
Finally, as the ranging protocol requires careful management of the
ultra-wideband radio and tight timing, we develop TriPoint, a dedicated
``drop-in'' ranging module that provides a simple \iic interface. We show that
this additional microcontroller demands only marginal energy overhead while
facilitating interoperability by freeing the primary microcontroller to
handle other tasks.

We present SurePoint, a system for drop-in, high-fidelity indoor localization.
SurePoint builds on recently available commercial ultra-wideband radio hardware.
While ultra-wideband radios provide a pairwise range estimate natively, we
show that with the addition of frequency and spatial diversity, we can achieve
a 53\% decrease in median range error.
Because this extra diversity requires many additional packets for each range
estimate, we leverage an efficient broadcast ranging protocol for
localization that ameliorates this overhead.
In stationary and fast-moving environments SurePoint achieves up to
0.08\,m median error and 0.53\,m 99th percentile error.
As ranging requires the tag to have exclusive access to the channel, we
employ a protocol to coordinate the localization of multiple tags in space.
This protocol builds on recent work exploiting the constructive interference
phenomenon, however SurePoint is the first to demonstrate constructive interface
using the 802.15.4a ultra-wideband PHY.
Finally, as the ranging protocol requires careful management of the
ultra-wideband radio and tight timing, we utilize TriPoint, a dedicated
``drop-in'' ranging module that provides a simple \iic interface. We show that
this additional microcontroller demands only marginal energy overhead while
facilitating interoperability by freeing the primary microcontroller to
handle other tasks.

This demo complements the paper ``SurePoint: Exploiting Ultra Wideband Flooding
and Diversity to Provide Robust, Scalable, High-Fidelity Indoor Localization''
to be presented at SenSys'16.

			<p> We present SurePoint, a system for drop-in, high-fidelity indoor localization. SurePoint builds on recently available commercial ultra-wideband radio hardware. While ultra-wideband radios provide a pairwise range estimate natively, we show that with the addition of frequency and spatial diversity, we can achieve a 53% decrease in median range error. Because this extra diversity requires many additional packets for each range estimate, we leverage an efficient broadcast ranging protocol for localization that ameliorates this overhead.

The gateway is a key component for sensor network deployments and the Internet
of Things. Sensor deployments often tend towards low-power communication
protocols such as Bluetooth Low Energy or IEEE 802.15.4. Gateways are essential
to connect these devices to the Internet at large. Over time though, gateways
have gained additional responsibilities as well. Sensors expect gateways to
handle device-specific data translation and local processing while also
providing services, such as time synchronization, to the low-power device. As a
centralized computing resource, the gateway is also an obvious location for
running local applications which interact with sensor data and control nearby
actuators. Today, vendors and researchers often create their own
device-specific gateways to handle these responsibilities.

We propose a generic gateway platform capable of supporting the needs of many
devices. In our architecture, devices provide a pointer, such as a URL, to
descriptions of their interfaces. The gateway can download the interface
descriptions and use them to determine how to interact with the device,
translating its data to a usable format and enabling local services to
communicate with it. The translated data is provided to services including user
applications, local logging, device status monitoring, and cloud applications.
By simultaneously supporting communication with many sensors, our gateway
architecture can simplify future sensor network deployments and enable
intelligent building applications.

The era of city-scale sensing is dawning. Supported by new sensing
capabilities, the capability to detect and measure phenomena throughout a
large area will allow deeper insight and understanding into how cities work.
The challenge of city-scale sensing is not limited to developing new sensing
applications, however. A sensor must be installed in a location. It must be
provided power, storage, and communications. All these tasks stand aside from
the desired sensing effort, but are necessary nevertheless.

In this demo, we introduce an initial prototype for a modular, city-scale
sensing platform---the signpost network. The platform, designed to be physically
attached to sign posts throughout a city, reduces the burden for sensor and
application developers by providing the necessary resources to modules attached
to it. Power is provided by harvesting from solar panels with battery storage,
with each module allocated a certain subset of the system energy. The signpost
platform also provides data storage, long-range communication, data
processing, module isolation, and an installation point for connected
modules. The signpost acts as a modular base station for researchers, citizen
scientists, and other interested parties to deploy custom sensors for
applications such as pedestrian counting, air quality monitoring, and RF
spectrum sensing at a city-wide scale.

We present Monoxalyze, a keychain-sized, Bluetooth-based, carbon
monoxide breathalyzer that aims to enable mobile, scalable smoking
cessation intervention programs. These intervention programs have
been shown to greatly increase the rate of a quit attempt, which in
turn decreases the rate of smoking, a major public health problem
that still affects over one billion people around the world.
Currently, intervention programs verify cessation compliance by
requiring pro- gram participants to periodically visit clinics and
exhale through large, expensive carbon monoxide breathalyzers—a
practice that cannot scale to one billion smokers. Monoxalyze
enables mobile ces- sation verification by working with a user’s
smartphone to establish a ring of spatio-temporal transitive trust
between the Monoxalyze device, the user, and the smartphone, a
concept that can be applied to many third-party monitoring
applications. In Monoxalyze, the links of this trust are
represented by simultaneous exhalation verification, facial
recognition, and device-to-phone visible light authentication. In
our evaluation, we show that Monoxalyze lasts over 80 days be-
tween charges, and has the ability to verify a Monoxalyze user.
With a small user study we show that Monoxalyze determines smoking
cessation with 92% accuracy, a level comparable with commercial CO
breathalyzers. Further contributions describe the design
decisions behind creating a low-power BLE device.

We believe that the future of human-building interaction lies
in the mediation of human-human interactions. In this work
we introduce a smart home application called Ghosting,
which is a two-way telepresence system that synchronizes
the audio and lighting state of two homes at a room level.
This allows users to converse as they normally would while
sharing a home, such as by talking while in the same room
or by shouting across the house. Users can additionally experience
in real time the casual yet intimate interactions of
daily shared living, like hearing the remote occupant walking
from room to room, coughing and shuffling papers just
around the corner, and seeing the lights turn on and off.
Due to its broad appeal, shared virtual living could lead to
the widespread deployment of space synchronization infrastructure,
forming a global home-to-home network. We
explore the new applications and economies that could
emerge from such a network, given the capabilities of the
Ghosting infrastructure.

We introduce \emph{Harmonium}, a novel ultra-wideband RF localization architecture
that achieves decimeter-scale accuracy indoors.
Harmonium strikes a balance between tag simplicity and processing complexity to
provide fast and accurate indoor location estimates.
Harmonium uses only commodity components and consists of a small, inexpensive,
lightweight, and FCC-compliant ultra-wideband transmitter or \emph{tag}, fixed
infrastructure \emph{anchors} with known locations, and centralized processing
that calculates the tag's position.
Anchors employ a new frequency-stepped narrowband receiver architecture that
rejects narrowband interferers and
extracts high-resolution timing information without the cost or complexity of
traditional ultra-wideband approaches.
In a complex indoor environment, 90\% of position estimates obtained with
Harmonium exhibit less than 31\,cm of error with an average 9\,cm of inter-sample
noise. In non-line-of-sight conditions (i.e. through-wall), 90\% of position error is less than
42\,cm.
The tag draws 75\,mW when actively transmitting, or 3.9\,mJ per location fix
at the 19\,Hz update rate.  Tags weigh 3\,g and cost \$4.50\,USD at modest
volumes.
Harmonium introduces a new design point for indoor localization
and enables localization of small, fast objects such as micro quadrotors,
devices previously restricted to expensive optical motion capture
systems.

			<pre>Bluetooth Low Energy beacons have immense potential
to provide rich contextual information to smartphone applications and people by bridging the physical and digital
worlds. Beacons perform the simple operation of periodically chirping URLs, locations, and other pointers, however,
today’s beacons use relatively large and battery powered implementations. To truly make these beacons pervasive, they
will need to be smaller, self-powered, and, ideally, invisible. To facilitate this, we propose the Cinamin beacon design
that exploits the powerful but simple primitive of periodic
packet broadcast to replace the volume-defining battery with
an energy-harvesting power supply and achieve a beacon in
under 100 mm 3 . This design, however, raises new issues
relevant to energy-harvesting and challenges with pursuing
miniaturization.

			<pre>We are becoming increasingly surrounded by smart and connected devices,
popularly known as the Internet of Things. The emerging user interface
paradigm for many such things eschews physical buttons, knobs, and displays in
favor of virtual interfaces that are downloaded from the web and rendered on
remote platforms---like smartphones. However, such smartphone app-based
interfaces often require tedious discovery and installation, as well as device
discovery, pairing, and configuration before a user can interact with a nearby
device. Requiring an explicit app install for each new device type scales
poorly with device growth, and particularly hinders casual interactions with
ambient devices. Instead of the high-friction, walled-garden approach now
taking root, we propose name, a physical web browser that provides a seamless,
scalable approach to browsing and interacting with nearby things. name
leverages multiple network patterns and modern web technologies to provide
users with rich device interfaces, even for devices under network or power
constraints. We argue that this approach scales better and that it provides
more intuitive and natural functionality for both users and developers. This
demo presents the basic concept, allows others to experience our preliminary
implementation, and raises several open research questions.

			<pre>Building connected, pervasive, human-facing, and responsive applications
that incorporate local sensors, smartphone interactions, device actuation, and
cloud-based learning---the promised features of the Internet of
Things (IoT)---requires a complete suite of tools spanning both hardware and software.
We present a set of these pieces, including a gateway, four hardware building
blocks, multiple sensor platforms, an indoor localization system, and software
for connecting users and devices.
Each piece plays an integral role towards
enabling applications, from facilitating rapid development of wireless smart
devices to composing data streams and services from a diverse set of components.
By providing layered interoperable systems, our toolkit offers cohesive
support for moving beyond single-device, cloud-centric applications---typical
in today's IoT landscape---and towards richer applications that incorporate
multiple data streams, human interaction, cloud processing, location awareness,
multiple communication protocols, historical data, access control, and
on-demand user interfaces.
To show how the pieces in the toolkit cooperate, we demonstrate a location-based
access control application where a user's smartphone can control a room's lighting,
but only from within the room. Further, data streams from the phone and
nearby sensors are used to provide a constant lighting service which attempts
to maintain a user-set brightness under variable external lighting conditions.

			<pre>We present PowerBlade, the smallest and lowest power AC plug-load
meter that measures real, reactive and apparent power, and reports this
data, along with cumulative energy consumption, over an
industry-standard Bluetooth Low Energy radio. Achieving this design
point requires revisiting every aspect of conventional power meters: a
new method of acquiring voltage; a non-invasive, planar method of
current measurement; an efficient and accurate method of computing
power from the voltage and current channels; a radio interface that
leverages nearby smart phones to display data and report it to the
cloud; and a retro power supply reimagined with vastly lower current
draw, allowing extreme miniaturization. PowerBlade occupies a mere 1" by 1"
footprint, offers a 1/16" profile, draws 176~mW continuously,
offers 1.13\% error on unity power factor loads in the 2-1200~W range
and slightly worse for non-linear and reactive loads, and costs \$11 in
modest quantities of about 1000 units. This new design point enables
affordable large-scale studies of plug-load energy usage---an area of
growing national importance.

			<pre>We demonstrate PolyPoint, a high-fidelity RF-based indoor localization system that
achieves 28~cm accuracy indoors and tracks a fast-moving quadcopter with only
56~cm average error.
PolyPoint uses ultra-wideband signals to achieve high precision RF time-of-flight
estimates between nodes. To further improve accuracy, PolyPoint exploits two forms
of diversity: frequency diversity, which leverages several ultra-wideband
channels to improve channel response, and antenna diversity, which adds three
antennas at $120\degree$ offsets to mitigate the effects of antenna
polarization and nulls. PolyPoint introduces an efficient, novel ranging protocol
that maximizes these diversity sources with a minimal number of packets.

Additionally, this work introduces a new hardware platform that provides
ranging and localization as a service. The minimal \emph{TriPoint} module
integrates an ultra-wideband transceiver and microcontroller with firmware
that implements the PolyPoint protocol. The \emph{TriTag} carrier board adds
Bluetooth and batteries to create a complete mobile tag, and the
\emph{TriBase} anchor platform integrates a TriPoint with an Intel Edison to
act as anchors for the system.

			<pre>Despite the dominance of social networking and communications in
nearly every aspect of our digital lives, little work has been
done to examine the unique contributions that networked smart
homes can make in the space of technologically-mediated human
interaction. In this work, we introduce an application called
"ghosting" that turns a smart and connected home into a
socially-connected home. We show that unlike direct
teleconferencing, the Internet of Things supports more
subtle, ambient, and incidental exchanges that can make an
environment feel co-inhabited by a person who may be many
miles away. Ghosting synchronizes audio and lighting between
two homes on a room-by-room basis. Microphones in each room
transmit audio to the corresponding room in the other home,
unifying the ambient sound domains of the two homes. For example,
a user cooking in their kitchen transmits sounds out of
speakers in the other user's own kitchen. The lighting
context in corresponding rooms is also synchronized. A light
toggled in one house toggles the lights in the other house in
real time. We claim that this system allows for casual
interactions that feel natural and intimate because they
share context and require less social effort than a
teleconference or phone call. We describe the design points
of the system and explore the successes and limitations of
the ghosting user experience by implementing and deploying a
ghosting application in two different settings.

			<pre>Rust, a new systems programming language, provides
compile-time memory safety checks to help eliminate runtime bugs that
manifest from improper memory management. This feature is advantageous
for operating system development, and especially for embedded OS
development, where recovery and debugging are particularly challenging.
However, embedded platforms are highly event-based, and Rust's memory
safety mechanisms largely presume threads. In our experience developing
an operating system for embedded systems in Rust, we have found that
Rust's {\em ownership} model prevents otherwise safe resource sharing
common in the embedded domain, conflicts with the reality of hardware
resources, and hinders using closures for programming asynchronously.
We describe these experiences and how they relate to memory safety as
well as illustrate our workarounds that preserve the safety guarantees
to the largest extent possible. In addition, we draw from our
experience to propose a new language extension to Rust that would
enable it to provide better memory safety tools for event-driven
platforms.

			<pre>We introduce PolyPoint, the first RF localization system which enables the
real-time tracking and navigating of quadrotors through complex indoor
environments.  PolyPoint leverages the new ScenSor transceiver from DecaWave
to acquire the timestamps necessary for accurate time-based location
estimation and leverages the benefits of antenna and frequency diversity to
iteratively refine a tag's position.
PolyPoint produces quadrotor position estimates at a rate of 20\,Hz with
median error below 40\,cm and average error of 56\,cm in line-of-sight
conditions.  PolyPoint approaches the localization accuracy necessary to safely
navigate quadrotors indoors, a feat currently achieved by costly and
delicate optical motion capture systems.

			<pre>The emergence of the Internet of Things will cause the density
of wirelessly networked devices to increase significantly.  As the industry
and density continue to grow, enabling and managing networks of these devices
in a scalable manner without constant user interaction becomes essential.
Noting that information about physical context can guide interactions between
devices, we introduce the desktop area network and Ving, a vibratory
ping architecture that enables it. Ving is based on the wireless vibratory
communications channel between a vibratory motor on one device and an
accelerometer on another.  Because vibratory communications is a
physically-coupled, surface-constrained communications domain, Ving allows
devices to bootstrap networks within their physical context, creating a
literal desktop area network.  Such context establishment and network
creation enables a new class of applications for smartphones and embedded
devices.  We present several of these applications, discuss our preliminary
implementation of Ving, compare Ving to alternate methods of context
establishment, and suggest potential research challenges stemming from the
widespread use of Ving.</pre>

			<pre>As we show in this paper, I/O has become the limiting
factor in scaling down size and power toward the goal of
invisible computing. Achieving this goal will require
composing optimized and specialized---yet
reusable---components with an interconnect that permits
tiny, ultra-low power systems.  In contrast to today's
interconnects which are limited by power-hungry
pull-ups or high-overhead chip-select lines, our
approach provides a superset of common bus features but
at lower power, with fixed area and pin count, using
fully synthesizable logic, and with surprisingly low
protocol overhead.

We present \textbf{MBus}, a new 4-pin,
22.6\,pJ/bit/chip chip-to-chip interconnect made of two
``shoot-through'' rings.  MBus facilitates ultra-low
power system operation by implementing automatic
power-gating of each chip in the system, easing the
integration of active, inactive, and activating
circuits on a single die.  In addition, we introduce a
new bus primitive: power oblivious communication, which
guarantees message reception regardless of the
recipient's power state when a message is sent.  This
disentangles power management from communication,
greatly simplifying the creation of viable, modular,
and heterogeneous systems that operate on the order of
nanowatts.

To evaluate the viability, power, performance,
overhead, and scalability of our design, we build both
hardware and software implementations of MBus and show
its seamless operation across two FPGAs and twelve
custom chips from three different semiconductor
processes.  A three-chip, 2.2\,mm$^3$ MBus system draws
8\,nW of total system standby power and uses only
22.6\,pJ/bit/chip for communication.  This is the
lowest power for any system bus with MBus's feature
set.

			<pre>In developing technology for indoor localization, we have recently
begun exploring commercially available state of the art localization technologies.
The DecaWave DW1000 is a new ultra-wideband
transceiver that advertises high-precision indoor pairwise ranging
between modules with errors as low as 10 cm. We are currently exploring this
technology to automate obtaining anchor ground-truth
locations for other indoor localization systems. Anchor positioning
is a constrained version of indoor localization, with minimal time
constraints and static devices. However, as we intend to include the
DW1000 hardware on our own localization system, this provides
an opportunity for gathering performance data for a commercially-enabled
localization system deployed by a third-party for comparison purposes.
We do not claim the ranging hardware as our originalwork, but we do provide a
hardware implementation, an infrastructure for converting pairwise measurements
to locations, and the front-end for viewing the results.</pre>

			<pre>Meaningful, reusable applications built on top of ubiquitous and networked
devices will be slow to materialize as long as device APIs vary widely, communication
protocols are not standardized, and programming support is limited and
inconsistent. When even feature-identical devices present different APIs
and application creators are burdened with managing the variability,
the promise of the swarm of devices will go unrealized. We start addressing
this issue by providing a model for devices, based on input and output ports, that allows for a set of common
interfaces to represent a range of devices. Further, we provide a solution
to the bootstrapping problem, providing a general means to
bridge the adoption gap for a new API for the Internet of Things.
We borrow both the name, \emph{accessor}, and several key design concepts from
a recent proposal by Latronico~et.\,al, for our interface layer that wraps
currently non-conforming devices with the standard interface. We show how
a small, straightforward to write (and read) JavaScript file can convert
diverse devices into common interfaces that are conducive for creating applications.

We realize our system with three environments that can execute accessors,
Python, Java, and Node.js, a range of accessors for both IoT and legacy devices,
and a browser-based application for interacting with devices using our proposed
interfaces. We show how the same accessor mechanism can form synthetic devices
with higher-level interfaces and we outline how our system can be extended
to support authentication, accessor control, and cloud storage support.

Luxapose addresses the indoor localization problem
with unmodified smartphones and software controlled LED luminaires.
Each luminaire, while providing normal lighting for a space,
transmits an identifier by switching the luminaire on-and-off at a particular
frequency. The pulses are imperceptible to humans, but smartphone
cameras can detect the switching by exploiting the rolling shutter effect
of CMOS cameras. Once the camera captures an image, the image
is processed to find the luminaires, determine their identifiers,
construct a sufficiently constrained angle-of-arrival localization
problem, and ultimately calculate the smartphone's position and
orientation in space.

Luxapose requires LED lighting infrastructure for localization, however,
the LED lights can replace the current lighting in a building. Luxapose
has virtually no cost to the end-users, requiring just an app on the
smartphone they already carry. The system has demonstrated ninetieth percentile
position error of 10~cm and orientation error of 10~degrees when the
smartphone is held under the LED luminaires.

			<pre>We introduce {\em Harmonia}, a new RF-based localization scheme
that provides the simplicity, cost, and power advantages of
traditional narrowband radios with the decimeter-scale
accuracy of ultra wideband localization techniques. Harmonia is
an asymmetric {\em tag} and {\em anchor} system, requiring
minimal modifications to existing low-power wireless devices
to support high-fidelity localization with comparatively
modest infrastructure costs.  A prototype Harmonia design offers
location estimates with an average-case error of 53.4~cm in
complex, heavy-multipath, indoor environments and captures
location estimates at 56~Hz while requiring only 1.7~mA
additional power draw for each tag and complying with all

combination of accuracy, update rate, power draw, and system
complexity will lead to a new point in the design space.

Power meters are critical for submetering loads in residential and commercial settings, but high installation cost and complexity hamper their broader adoption. Recent approaches address installation burdens by proposing non-invasive meters that easily clip onto a wire, or stick onto a circuit breaker, to perform contactless metering. Unfortunately, these designs require regular maintenance (e.g.\ battery replacement) or reduce measurement accuracy (e.g.\ work poorly with non-unity power factors). This paper presents Gemini, a new design point in the power metering space. Gemini addresses the drawbacks of prior approaches by decoupling and distributing the AC voltage and current measurement acquisitions, and recombining them wirelessly using a low-bandwidth approach, to offer non-invasive real, reactive, and apparent power metering. Battery maintenance is eliminated by using an energy-harvesting design that enables the meter to power itself using a current transformer. Accuracy is substantially improved over other non-invasive meters by virtualizing the voltage channel---effectively allowing the meter to calculate power as if it could directly measure voltage (since true power requires sample-by-sample multiplication of current and voltage measurements acquired with tight timing constraints). Collectively, these improvements result in a new design point that meters resistive loads with 0.6\,W average error and a range of reactive and switching loads with 2.2\,W average error---matching commercial, mains-powered solutions.

			<pre>Understanding building usage patterns and resource consumption,
particularly for existing buildings, requires a sensing infrastructure
for the building. Often, deploying these sensors and obtaining
real-time information is hindered by installation and maintenance
difficulties resulting from scaling down and powering these devices.
Devices that rely on batteries are limited by the scale of the
batteries and the maintenance cost of replacing them while AC mains
powered sensors incur high upfront installation costs. To mitigate
these burdens, we present a new architecture for designing
building-monitoring focused energy-harvesting sensors. The key to this
architecture is masking the inevitable inter-mittency provided by
energy-harvesting with a trigger abstraction that activates the device
only when there is useful work to be done. In this paper, we describe
our architecture and demonstrate how it supports existing
energy-harvesting sensor designs. Further, we realize three additional
design points within the architecture and demonstrate how the sensors
are effective at building monitoring and event detection. The sensors,
however, are classically disruptive: they improve ease of installation
and maintenance, but to do so, they sacrifice some fidelity and
reliability. Whether this trade-off is acceptable remains to be
explored, but the technology needed to do so is now here.</pre>

			<p>Understanding building usage patterns and resource consumption, particularly for existing buildings, requires a sensing infrastructure for the building. Often, deploying these sensors and obtaining real-time information is hindered by installation and maintenance difficulties resulting from scaling down and powering these devices. Devices that rely on batteries are limited by the scale of the batteries and the maintenance cost of replacing them while AC mains powered sensors incur high upfront installation costs.

			<pre>Fine-grained energy metering in homes and buildings provides a promising
technique for addressing the unmaintainable energy consumption levels of
worldwide buildings. Metering electricity, lighting, natural gas, HVAC,
occupancy, and water on a per appliance or room basis can provide invaluable insight
when trying to reduce a building's energy footprint. A myriad of sensor designs
and systems collect data on particular building aspects, but are often hampered
by installation difficulty or ongoing maintenance needs (like battery
replacement). We address these common pitfalls for water and heat metering by
developing a small, energy-harvesting sensor that meters using the same
thermoelectric generator with which it powers itself. In short, the rate at which
the harvester captures energy is proportional to the heat production of the
monitored appliance or pipe and this relationship allows us to estimate energy use
simply based on the sensor's ability to harvest. We prototype our sensor in a
bracelet shaped form-factor that can attach to a shower head pipe, faucet, or
appliance to provide local hot water or heat metering.</pre>

			<pre>Currently, researchers study face-to-face interactions using wearable sensors and
smartphones which provide 2 to 5~m proximity sensing every 20 to 300~s.
However, studying interaction distance, which is known to
impact disease spread, communication behavior, and other phenomenon, has
proven challenging.
Smartphones are limited by their inaccurate and/or
impractical ranging capabilities, while wearable sensors
are limited by their need for
infrastructure nodes, bulkiness, and/or inaccurate ranging.
To address these challenges, we present Opo, a 14~cm$^2$, 11.4~g ``lapel pin''
built from commercial components.
Opo sensors range neighbors every 2~s up to 2~m away with 5\% average
error, all while requiring zero
infrastructure and improving upon current wearable sensors' accuracy and power usage.
The cornerstone of Opo is an ultrasonic wakeup circuit that draws 19~\uA
when no neighbors are present. This enables Opo sensors to discover and range
neighbors without the need for infrastructure nodes and slow or power-hungry
RF discovery protocols.
Thus, Opo is able to sense interaction distance with high accuracy (5~cm)
and temporal fidelity (2~s) on a limited power budget.

			<pre>For the last fifteen years, research explored the hardware,
software, sensing, communication abstractions, languages, and
protocols that could make networks of small, embedded
devices---motes---sample and report data for long
periods of time unattended.
Today, the application and technological landscapes
have shifted, introducing new requirements and new
capabilities. Hardware has evolved past 8~and 16~bit
microcontrollers: there are now 32~bit processors with
lower energy budgets and greater computing capability.
New wireless link layers have emerged, creating
protocols that support rapid and efficient setup and
teardown but introduce novel limitations that systems
must consider.
The time has come to look beyond optimizing networks of
motes. We look towards new technologies such as
Bluetooth Low Energy, Cortex~M processors, and capable
energy harvesting, with new application spaces such as
personal area networks, and new capabilities and
requirements in security and privacy to inform
contemporary hardware and software platforms.  It is
time for a new, open experimental platform in this
post-mote era.

			<pre>We propose an ultra-low power interconnect bus for
millimeter-scale wireless sensor nodes. Using only 4~IO pads,
the bus minimizes the required chip real estate, enabling
ultra-small form factors in modular sensor node
designs. Low power is achieved using a ``clockless''
design of member nodes while aggressive power gating
allows an ultra-low power standby mode with only
53~gates powered on. An integrated wakeup scheme is
compatible with PMUs that have a special low power
standby mode. The MBus is fully synthesizable and uses
robust timing. Implemented in a 3~module system in
180~nm technology, Mbus achieves 8~nW of standby power
and 17.5~pJ/bit/chip.

			<pre>We explore the indoor positioning problem with unmodified smartphones
and slightly-modified commercial LED luminaires.  The
luminaires---modified to allow rapid, on-off keying---transmit their
identifiers and/or locations encoded in human-imperceptible optical
pulses.  A camera-equipped smartphone, using just a single image frame
capture, can detect the presence of the luminaires in the image,
decode their transmitted identifiers and/or locations, and determine
the smartphone's location and orientation relative to the luminaires.
Continuous image capture and processing enables continuous position
updates.
The key insights underlying this work are (i) the driver circuits of
emerging LED lighting systems can be easily modified to transmit data
through on-off keying; (ii) the rolling shutter effect of CMOS imagers
can be leveraged to receive many bits of data encoded in the optical
transmissions with just a single frame capture, (iii) a camera is
intrinsically an angle-of-arrival sensor, so the projection of
multiple nearby light sources with known positions onto a camera's
image plane can be framed as an instance of a sufficiently-constrained
angle-of-arrival localization problem, and (iv) this problem can be
solved with optimization techniques.

			<pre>We introduce {\em Harmonia}, a new RF-based localization scheme
that provides the simplicity, cost, and power advantages of
traditional narrowband radios with the decimeter-scale
accuracy of ultra wideband localization techniques. Harmonia is
an asymmetric {\em tag} and {\em anchor} system, requiring
minimal modifications to existing low-power wireless devices
to support high-fidelity localization with comparatively
modest infrastructure costs.  A prototype Harmonia design offers
location estimates with an average-case error of 53.4~cm in
complex, heavy-multipath, indoor environments and captures
location estimates at 56~Hz while requiring only 1.7~mA
additional power draw for each tag and complying with all
US~UWB regulations.  We believe this architecture's
combination of accuracy, update rate, power draw, and system
complexity will lead to a new point in the design space.

			<pre>After years of development, cost-effective, energy-efficient, and
long-lasting solid-state lighting technology is finally a viable alternative
to incandescent and fluorescent lights.  Unfortunately, the remarkable march
of semiconductor technology into the lighting industry is almost entirely in
the form of a substitute good---one kind of lighting technology that replaces
another---but this, we argue, squanders a unique opportunity for lighting to
enable a bevy of new applications.  In this paper, we discuss applications in
health, energy efficiency, entertainment, communications, indoor positioning,
device configuration, and time synchronization.  We then prototype several of
the indoor applications to explore a {\em software-defined lighting} (SDL)
architecture that could support them.

Using our prototyped applications, we next take a primitive stab at
demonstrating application coexistence, multiplexing multiple applications on
a single lighting network.  A major question raised by this effort is how to
multiplex these various applications in a more principled manner on a shared
lighting infrastructure whose primary role is illumination (implying that any
human-perceptible flicker or flashing will be unacceptable).
Looking ahead, we draw inspiration from software-defined networking's
approach to sharing the network, and software-defined radios' approach to
processing waveforms, to sketch the beginnings of an SDL architecture and its
application programming interfaces.

be secure against computer-based attacks, but this is not always the case.
We investigate a networked traffic signal system currently deployed in the
United States and discover a number of security flaws that exist due to
systemic failures by the designers. We leverage these flaws to create attacks
which gain control of the system, and we successfully demonstrate them on the
deployment in coordination with authorities. Our attacks show that an
adversary can control traffic infrastructure to cause disruption, degrade
safety, or gain an unfair advantage. We make recommendations on how to improve

			<pre>The Internet of Things (IoT) is a rapidly emerging
application space, poised to become the largest
electronics market for the semiconductor industry. IoT
devices are focused on sensing and actuating of our
physical environment and have a nearly unlimited
breadth of uses. In this paper, we explore the IoT
application space and then identify two common
challenges that exist across this space: ultra-low
power operation and system design using modular,
composable components. We survey recent low power
techniques and discuss a low power bus that enables
modular design. Finally, we conclude with three example
ultra-low power, millimeter-scale IoT systems.

			<pre>Current submetering systems suffer from prohibitive device costs, invasive
installations, and burdensome maintenance.  In this paper we present
Deltaflow, a submetering system that can estimate the power draw of individual
loads by augmenting aggregate measurements with very simple sensors. The key
insight is that we can drastically reduce sensor complexity by encoding
information in the mere existence of a radio transmission, rather than the
contents of that transmission. A sensor consisting simply of a radio and an
energy-harvesting power supply tuned to harvest a side-channel emission of
energy consumption (e.g. light, heat, magnetic field, vibration) will
exhibit an activation frequency that is correlated with the power draw of the
load to which it is affixed. These sensors report their activations to the
data-processing backend, which can determine the actual power draw by
incorporating ground truth aggregate measurements such as those provided by
utility meters. The server maps sensor activations to energy consumption by observing
when the aggregate measurement and the sensor activation frequency change simultaneously.
The server iteratively partitions the system history into discrete states which are
used to construct and solve instances of a linear optimization problem. Solutions
to the problem reveal the mapping from pulse frequencies to individual load power draw.
This systems approach to submetering results in deployments that are easy to
install and maintain, while contributing zero additional load, enabling building
owners and occupants to simply affix tags to energy consumers and automatically begin
receiving real-time power draw readings.

			<pre>The power grid is one of humanity's most significant engineering
undertakings and it is essential in developed and developing nations
alike.  Currently, transparency into the power grid relies on
utility companies and more fine-grained insight is provided by
costly smart meter deployments. We claim that greater
visibility into power grid conditions can be provided in an
inexpensive and crowd-sourced manner independent of utility
companies by leveraging existing smartphones.  Our key insight
is that an unmodified smartphone can detect power outages by
monitoring changes to its own power state, locally verifying
these outages using a variety of sensors that reduce the
likelihood of false power outage reports, and corroborating
actual reports with other phones through data aggregation in
the cloud.  The proposed approach enables a decentralized
system that can scale, potentially providing researchers and
concerned citizens with a powerful new tool to analyze the
power grid and hold utility companies accountable for poor
power quality.  This paper demonstrates the viability of the
basic idea, identifies a number of challenges that are
specific to this application as well as ones that are common
to many crowd-sourced applications, and highlights some
improvements to smartphone operating systems that could better
support such applications in the future.</pre>

			<pre>{\bf Introduction:} Mobile phones hold considerable promise for delivering evidence-based smoking cessation interventions that require frequent and objective assessment of smoking status via breath carbon monoxide (Breath CO) measurement. However, there are currently no commercially available mobile-phone-based Breath CO meters. We developed a mobile-phone-based Breath CO meter prototype that attaches to and communicates with a smartphone through an audio port. The purpose of the current study was to evaluate the reliability and validity of Breath CO measures collected with the mobile meter prototype and assess the usability and acceptability of the meter.

{\bf Methods:} Participants included 20 regular smokers (≥10 cigarettes/day), 20 light smokers (<10 cigarettes/day), and 20 nonsmokers. Expired air samples were collected 4 times from each participant: twice with the mobile meter and twice with a com- mercially available Breath CO meter.

{\bf Results:} Measures calculated by the mobile meter correlated strongly with measures calculated by the commercial meter (r = .96, p < .001). In addition, the mobile meter accurately distinguished between smokers and nonsmokers. The area under the receiver-operating characteristic curve for the mobile meter was 94.7\%, and the meter had a combined sensitivity and specificity of 1.86 at an abstinence threshold of ≤6 ppm. Responses on an acceptability survey indicated that smokers liked the meter and would be interested in using it during a quit attempt.

{\bf Conclusions:} The results of the current study suggest that a mobile-phone-based Breath CO meter is a reliable, valid, and acceptable device for distinguishing between smokers and nonsmokers.

			<pre>Obtaining a detailed, whole-house breakdown of energy usage would
allow for homeowners to better understand their energy consumption and
indentify opportunities for energy savings. Current solutions are too
course-grained, too difficult to deploy, not networked, or offer poor
coverage of hard to meter items, such as ceiling lights.
To address these problems, we demonstrate a wirelessly networked,
energy-harvesting power metering system that draws zero standby power
and is power proportional to the load it is metering.  The system is
comprised of three different meters: one for plugged-in loads, one for
panel-level circuits, and one for hard-to-sense loads, such as ceiling
lights.  Each meter harvests energy proportionally to the load it is
measuring and powers a sensor node intermittently.
Together, these sensors create multiple data streams which are
aggregated by a receiver. When combined with a calibrated meter that
measures total household power, our system can iteratively determine
the contributions of each load to the total power usage, allowing
users to gain a broad yet detailed view of their energy consumption
and costs.</pre>

			<pre>Conventional AC power meters perform at least two distinct functions:
power conversion, to supply the meter itself, and energy metering, to
measure the load consumption.  This paper presents Monjolo, a new
energy-metering architecture that combines these two functions to
yield a new design point in the metering space.  The key insight
underlying this work is that the output of a current transformer --
nominally used to measure a load current -- can be harvested and used
to {\em intermittently} power a wireless sensor node.  The hypothesis
is that the node's activation frequency increases monotonically with
the primary load's draw, making it possible to estimate load power
from the interval between activations, assuming the node consumes a
fixed energy quanta during each activation.  This paper explores this
thesis by designing, implementing, and evaluating the Monjolo
metering architecture.  The results demonstrate that it is possible to
build a meter that draws zero-power under zero-load conditions, offers
high accuracy for near-unity power factor loads, works with non-unity
power factor loads in combination with a whole-house meter, wirelessly
reports readings to a data aggregator, is resilient to communication
failures, and is parsimonious with the radio channel, even under heavy
loads.  Monjolo eliminates the high-voltage AC-DC power supply and AC
metering circuitry present in earlier designs, enabling a smaller,
simpler, safer, and lower-cost design point that supports novel
deployment scenarios like non-intrusive circuit-level metering.

			<pre>We propose Get All The Data (GATD), a data collection and dissemination
system for the Swarm. GATD offers a flexible architecture to connect arbitrary
producers of data and consumers of events. Too many sensor networks are
fragile, vertical silos, with a series of one-off handlers written to shuttle
data, manipulate it, process it, and present it. Instead of being mired
in details and rigid schemas, we argue that sensor network deployment should
be simple. The key in GATD's design is the
observation that there are common patterns to how disparate sensor network
applications handle and process their generated data.

To take advantage of these
similarities we present a system comprised of common modules that
different applications can leverage.
To join GATD, new sensors simply send raw data. GATD will buffer this raw
data indefinitely until an application specific {\em formatter} is written to
map the raw data to key-value pairs. These streams can be combined, processed,
graphed, stored, or otherwise manipulated by a standard set of transforms or
new custom drivers. With this architecture, we argue that GATD provides a
robust, extensible, and versatile Swarm dataplane.

			<pre>Capturing the spatial and temporal aspects of human interactions allows for better
informed disease transmission models. Various smart badge type solutions have been
devised to capture these parameters, but their real world deployability is
minimal. The key problem stems from the unpredictability of mobile neighbors,
which makes synchronization and neighbor discovery difficult, resulting in
either bulky, high powered nodes or infrastructure heavy systems. In this paper,
we present Opo, a small, ultrasonic wakeup circuit that draws 16~\uA when no
neighbors are present, allowing nodes to remain asleep most of the time and be
asynchronously awoken when other nodes are present. This solves the
synchronization problem without requiring large batteries or infrastructure
nodes, enabling easily deployable systems to characterize the spatial and
temporal aspects of human interactions.

			<pre>We present AudioDAQ, a new platform for continuous data acquisition
using the headset port of a mobile phone.  AudioDAQ differs from
existing phone peripheral interfaces by drawing all necessary power
from the microphone bias voltage, encoding all data as analog audio,
and leveraging the phone's built-in voice memo application (or a
custom application) for continuous data collection.
These properties make the AudioDAQ design more universal, so it works
across a broad range of phones including sophisticated smart phones
and simpler feature phones, enables simple analog peripherals without
requiring a microcontroller, requires no hardware or software
modifications on the phone itself, uses significantly less power than
prior approaches, and allows continuous data capture over an extended
period of time. The AudioDAQ design is efficient because it draws all
necessary power from the microphone bias voltage, and it is general
because this voltage and a voice memo application are present on most
mobile phones in use today.  We show the viability of our architecture
by evaluating an end-to-end system that can capture EKG signals
continuously for hours and send the data to the cloud for storage,
processing, and visualization.</pre>

			<pre>Most modern software-defined radios are large, expensive, and
power-hungry, and this diminishes their utility in low-power,
size-constrained settings like sensor networks and mobile computing.
We explore the viability of scaling down the software radio in size,
cost, and power, and show that an index card-sized, sub-\$150, `AA'
battery-powered system is possible using off-the-shelf components.
Key to our approach is that we leverage an integrated, reconfigurable,
flash-based FPGA with a hard ARM Cortex-M3 microprocessor which
simultaneously enables lower power and tighter hardware/soft\-ware
integration than prior designs.  This architecture allows us to
implement timing-critical MAC protocols and validate the speculated
performance of several recent MAC/PHY primitives and protocols
including Backcast, A-MAC, and Glossy using an IEEE 802.15.4-compliant
radio implementation that interoperates with commercial radios.  The
work also identifies several enhancements in the underlying hardware
components that could improve power, performance, and flexibility.

			<pre>In this work we expose the challenges of interfacing both conventional and new
systems with an extremely resource constrained platform. We find that even when
attempts are made to utilize an industry standard protocol (I2C), necessary
protocol modifications for ultra-low power design means that interfacing remains
non-trivial.

We present a functional 0.4mm~x~0.8mm ARM Cortex~M0 with 3KB of RAM, 24~GPIOs,
and an ultra-low power I2C interface. This chip is part of the Michigan Micro
Mote (M3) project, which is designed to build a complete software and hardware
platform for general purpose sensing at the millimeter scale. We demo an I2C
interface circuit allowing commercial hardware to program and interact with the
chip and present the beginning of the millimeter scale sensing revolution.

			<pre>We study the problem of augmenting battery-powered sensornet trees
with energy-harvesting leaf nodes.  Our results show that leaf nodes
that are smaller in size than today's typical battery-powered sensors
can harvest enough energy from ambient sources to acquire and transmit
sensor readings every minute, even under poor lighting conditions.
However, achieving this functionality, especially as leaf nodes scale
in size, requires new platforms, protocols, and programming.
Platforms must be designed around low-leakage operation, offer a
richer power supply control interface for system software, and employ
an unconventional energy storage hierarchy.  Protocols must not only
be low-power, but they must also become low-energy, which affects
initial and ongoing synchronization, and periodic communications.
Systems programming, and especially bootup and communications, must
become low-latency, by eliminating conservative timeouts and startup
dependencies, and embracing high-concurrency.  Applying these
principles, we show that robust, indoor, perpetual sensing is viable
using off-the-shelf technology.

			<pre>Wireless sensor nodes have many compelling applications such
as smart buildings, medical implants, and surveillance
systems. However, existing devices are bulky, measuring
$>$~1\,cm$^3$, and they are hampered by short lifetimes and
fail to realize the ``smart dust'' vision of~[1]. Smart
dust requires a mm$^3$-scale, wireless sensor node with
perpetual energy harvesting. Recently two
application-specific implantable microsystems~[2][3]
demonstrated the potential of a mm$^3$-scale system in
medical applications. However, [3]~is not programmable
and~[2] lacks a method for re-programming or
re-synchronizing once encapsulated. Other practical
issues remain unaddressed, such as a means to protect
the battery during the time period between system
assembly and deployment and the need for flexible
design to enable use in multiple application domains.
To this end, we propose a 1.0\,mm$^3$ general-purpose
heterogeneous sensor node platform with a stackable
multi-layer structure that includes a new, ultra-low
power I$^2$C (Inter-Integrated Circuit) interface for
inter-layer communication. The system has an
ultra-low-power optical wakeup receiver and GOC (Global
Optical Communication), which enables
re-programming and synchronization. It also includes an
ultra-low power PMU (Power Management Unit) with BOD
(Brown-Out Detector) to prevent processor malfunctions
and battery damage. The BOD also controls a POR
(Power-On Reset) module in other layers to enable a
proper reset sequence. Image and temperature sensors
are implemented, but the modularity of the system
allows end-users to easily replace or add layers to
incorporate specific circuits in appropriate
technologies as needed.

			<pre>
The SmartGrid is ushering in an era of new IP endpoints that already
reside on the power grid today, but lack network connectivity.  Many
of these endpoints -- refrigerators, air conditioners, and power
strips -- will be networked wirelessly.  However, since they already
exist on the power grid, a natural question is whether they might be
networked over the same wires that supply their power.  Such an
approach would allow SmartGrid sensors to vacate increasingly
congested spectrum and allow information to flow along the same path
as power, perhaps simplifying deployment in the short term and deep
demand response in the long term.
In this paper we explore the current state of Powerline Communications
(PLC) and explore the efficacy of PLC as a sensor network backbone in
a modern building.  We evaluate several different PLC modems in both
end-to-end and multi-hop configurations.  We further analyze building
blueprints to identify and correlate several PLC ``disruptors'' --
building facets that inhibit PLC.  Our preliminary results show that
PLC is a promising technology for networking sensors in the Smart
Building.  However, a number of anomalies suggest a more in-depth
study is warranted.

			<pre>We endow the mobile phone with a low-cost, open interface that can
parasitically power external peripherals, and transfer data to and
from them, using analog, digital, and serial signaling, using
only the existing headset audio port. This interface, called
HiJack, allows the mobile phone to easily integrate with a
range of external sensors, opening the door to new
phone-centric sensing applications. In this paper, we
characterize the signaling and power delivery capability of
the audio jack, design circuits and software to transfer data
and harvest energy, and evaluate the performance of our
designs. We also use the mobile phone's audio channel to cre-
ate a layered communications stack that supports low-level,
analog signaling and high-level, multiplexed data
communications with external devices. Our design supports a
single, bi-directional communications channel at a data rate
of 8.82 kbps over a Manchester-encoded serial stream, using
just a few discrete components and the hardware peripherals
found in almost any microcontroller. Our harvester delivers
7.4 mW to a load with 47\% efficiency using components that
cost \$2.34 in 10K volume. Integrating the pieces, we present a
combined system for delivering data and power over audio, and
demonstrate its use by turning an iPhone into an inexpensive
oscilloscope, EKG monitor, and soil moisture sensor, all at
price points accessible to most consumers in developing
regions. </pre>

			<pre>Modern software-defined radios are large, expensive, and power-hungry
devices and this, we argue, hampers their more widespread
deployment and use, particularly in low-power,
size-constrained application settings like mobile phones and sensor
networks. To rectify this problem, we propose to put the
software-defined radio on a diet by redesigning it around just
two core chips -- an integrated RF transceiver and a
Flash-based, mixed-signal FPGA. Modern transceivers integrate
almost all RF front-end functions while emerging FPGAs
integrate nearly all of required signal conditioning and
processing functions. And, unlike conventional FPGAs,
Flash-based FPGAs offer sleep mode power draws measured in the
microamps and startup times measured in the microseconds,
both of which are critical for low-power operation. If our platform
architecture vision is realized, it will be possible to hold
a software-defined radio in the palm of one’s hand, build it
for \$100, and power it for days using the energy in a
typical mobile phone battery. This will make software radios
deployable in high densities and broadly accessible for
research and education.
