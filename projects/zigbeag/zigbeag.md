GAP.
========
A 802.15.4/BLE cape for the Beaglebone Black.
--------------------------------


Low-power sensor networks operating on 802.15.4 and BLE require a reliable and flexible border router. The GAP cape aims to allow the Beaglebone Black to replace the Raspberry Pi as the most suitable embedded linux platform for 802.15.4/BLE routing.

The Beaglebone Black's internal eMMC storage is more reliable than the often-corrupted SD cards used with the Raspberry Pi.
As of revision A, the GAP features two CC2520 radios, one of which is amplified with a CC2591 range-extender. A kernel driver is in development to control both radios.
Revision B will improve upon the design and include a BLE radio.
