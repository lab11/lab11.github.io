=========
Deployable, Modular, City-Scale Sensing
-------------------

The Signpost platform enables easily-deployable city-scale sensing. Signposts
can be mounted to any sign post, harvest solar energy, and provide the 
key services for their pluggable sensor modules to perform sensing tasks.
To enable multiple non-aligned sensor modules to operate within the resource
constraints of the system, Signposts meter resource utilization and
isolate sensor modules that use over their fair share. We have
created sensor modules for audio volume, rf spectrum, radar-based motion, and
ambient environmental sensing.
The platform is currently being deploying on UC Berkeley's campus, and
we hope to use it as a platform to test distributed, resource
constrained, software and hardware systems.
