VLC Localization.
=================
Positioning with LED lights and smartphones.
--------------------------------------------

Consumer GPS changed the world. Knowing one's location and the ability to
locate objects enabled whole fields of technologies. Yet there is no effective
system for accurate indoor localization.

Most state-of-the-art indoor localization systems provide _semantic
localization_, answering "Where Am I?" by telling the user what room or area of
a room they are in. We aim to provide true localization, in practice this
amounts to _order 1&nbsp;decimeter accuracy in 3D-space_.

To achieve this, we exploit the

modern smartphones. By modulating (blinking) LED lights at high frequency
(1-7&nbsp;kHz) each light appears solidly on to any people in the room while
communicating data to any smartphone in the room.
