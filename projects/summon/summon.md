Summon.
=========
Casually browsing the web of things.
-------------------

Summon enables users to find and directly interact with IoT devices from
their smartphone. Devices can beacon out pointers to web resources over
Bluetooth, mDNS, or uPnP, and summon well fetch the websites and provide
APIs through which the websites can interact directly with the device.
This removes the need to download a new app for every smart devices and 
instead extends the notion of web browsing into our physical spaces.
