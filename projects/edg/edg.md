EDG.
=========
Generate hardware designs from (annotated) software.
-------------------

Embedded Device Generation(EDG) can generate complete hardware designs from high-level specifications (like
annotated software). This level of abstraction can enable a new generation
of coders to take advantage of the increasingly accessible and popular fabrication
techniques without requiring them to learn the skills associated with traditional
hardware design. The system starts from the user-specified requirements and 
a library of available components and produces a block diagram containing
sufficient information to generate the finalized device firmware, bill of
materials, and circuit netlist.
