Permamote.
=========
Exploring reliable, low-power motes.
-------------------

Permamote combines energy-harvesting, a backing primary store battery,
and the newest, lowest power components
to achieve consistent operation over a greater than 10 year lifetime with
common sensor mote workloads.
Currently it performs ambient environmental sensing and reports data over
BLE and 802.15.4, however we hope the energy storage and harvesting system can
be reused and serve as a base for all future indoor sensor deployments.
