Wearabouts.
===========
Localization through wearables.
-------------------------------


Wearabouts is a system for indoor room-level localization of people. It detects
individuals via Bluetooth Low-Energy communications from the devices they carry
and determines their current location in a building. Wearabouts provides
location information as a service to other systems, enabling new smart
applications.

People and their devices are becoming intrinsically tied together. Smartphones
already accompany their owner for the majority of the day. Wearable devices
both continue and enhance this trend. The use of Bluetooth Low-Energy
communications on these devices means that they all continuously broadcast
their presence with advertisement packets. This allows them to serve a
secondary purpose as a proxy for localizing people. We propose that
non-intrusive room-level localization is possible by detecting devices that
people already carry and wear.

[HOMEPAGE_BREAK]

We propose that room-level localization is possible by comparing the
distribution of a series of signal strength measurements from the user's
unmodified devices to the expected distribution of devices inside of the room.
