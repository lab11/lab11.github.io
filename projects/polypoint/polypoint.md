PolyPoint.
=========
Accurate RF indoor localization.
-------------------

PolyPoint is a system for indoor localization using UWB RF time-of-flight
ranging. The system uses the DecaWave DW1000 as the UWB radio which provides
accurate timestamping of packet transmission and reception times. The key to
its accuracy is its ranging diversity: it uses three antennas on the tag,
three antennas on the anchor, and three UWB antennas to obtain 27 measurements
for each ranging event.

PolyPoint is designed to be a drop in system. All of the components (except
for UWB antennas) and software are included in the solder-on TriPoint module.
