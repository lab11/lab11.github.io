Slocalization.
=========
Low-power RF backscatter localization.
-------------------

Slocalization is a system for indoor localization using UWB, backscatter,
RF time-of-flight ranging. The system allows ultra low-power
backscatter tags to be localized slowly (minutes-hours depending on distance)
at decimeter accuracy. While the UWB backscatter signal would usually be
well below the noise floor, the signal is integrated over time to enable
its recovery.
