Monoxalyze
=========
Verifiable smoking cessation.
-------------------

Monoxalyze is a carbon monoxide breathalyzer that works with a user's smartphone
to verify smoking cessation. Monoxalyze verifies cessation by creating
transitive trust between the user, the smartphone, and the Monoxalyze device;
the links in this chain are created through facial recognition, visible light
authentication, and exhalation verification respectively. These links of
trust ensure that the correct user is exhaling sufficiently through the
expected Monoxalyze device.
