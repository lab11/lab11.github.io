Monitor the grid.
-----------------

The power grid is one of humanity's most significant engineering undertakings
and is essential in developed and developing nations alike.

Currently, transparency into the power grid relies on utilities and
more fine- grained insight is provided by costly smart meter
deployments. We claim that greater visibility into power grids can
be provided in an inexpensive, crowdsourced manner independent of
utilities by leveraging existing smartphones. Our key insight is
that an unmodified smartphone can  detect power outages by
monitoring changes to its own power state, locally verifying these
outages using a variety of sensors, and corroborating with other
phones through cloud services.

This approach enables a decentralized system that can scale, potentially providing researchers and concerned citizens with a powerful new tool to analyze the power grid and hold utilities accountable for
degradation in power grid quality.
